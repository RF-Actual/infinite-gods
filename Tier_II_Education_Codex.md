## I. Purpose

Education in Eden is not merely the transmission of knowledge—it is the harmonization of memory, purpose, and resilience. Institutions of higher learning are designed to preserve humanity’s mythic lineage, philosophical integrity, and functional mastery in a post-Reset world.

> “A weapon is made in the forge. A civilization is made in the Foundry.” – Lillian McDonald  
> “Education is not the acquisition of facts. It is the harmonization of purpose.” — Foundry Proverb
