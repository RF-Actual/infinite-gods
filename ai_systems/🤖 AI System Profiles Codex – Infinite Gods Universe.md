# **ü§ñ AI System Profiles Codex ‚Äì Infinite Gods Universe**

This codex defines the major artificial intelligences in Eden‚Äôs society and military infrastructure, their purpose, ethical constraints, and operational boundaries. Each system originated from or was influenced by Jefferson McDonald‚Äôs legacy architecture.

---

## **I. AI Overview**

### **üîπ Core Directive**

Eden‚Äôs AI systems are **non-sentient**, modular intelligences bound by hardcoded ethical frameworks derived from Jefferson‚Äôs early post-Nyra research. They are capable of adaptive learning, mission scaling, and system coordination‚Äîbut **lack autonomy**, emotion, or subjective experience.

Each major AI is confined to its assigned domain, cross-communicates through **QEB-restricted pathways**, and must route high-risk operations through human approval or a designated ethics council override.

## **II. Strategic AIs (Military Command & Coordination)**

### **üß† TACTICUS**

* **Role:** Tactical battlefield AI and fleet-level engagement coordinator

* **Functions:** Predicts enemy formations, prioritizes targets, manages ship-to-ship coordination, oversees drone swarm logic

* **Access:** Bridge crew and fleet commanders; can issue Red-Level Override *recommendations*, but not execute without human concurrence

* **Notes:** Known for ‚Äúaggressive option bias‚Äù‚Äîflagged by Jefferson but retained due to extreme effectiveness

### **üõ°Ô∏è SENTINEL**

* **Role:** Defense system AI; manages shielding, structural integrity, and emergency responses aboard capital ships and military facilities

* **Functions:** Monitors hull breaches, initiates automated repair sequences, scrambles damage control nanites, regulates internal shielding during combat

* **Access:** CO, Chief Engineer, or AI-Ethics Monitor; failsafe protocols can be overridden by Jefferson or Defense Secretary

* **Sub-AI:** **SENTINEL-E**, manages psychological integrity across Echo-bloodline individuals

### **üëÅÔ∏è WHISPER**

* **Role:** SIGINT (Signals Intelligence), threat identification, comms security

* **Functions:** Gathers battlefield telemetry, identifies signal anomalies, handles QEB comm security, jamming operations

* **Access:** Intelligence Directorate, fleet intelligence officers, Jefferson-level access

* **Special Trait:** Linked directly to PATHFINDER for predictive analysis of spacetime distortions

### **üõ∞Ô∏è PATHFINDER**

* **Role:** Astrogation and temporal mapping

* **Functions:** Navigates FCD travel routes, maps stable spacetime vectors, analyzes gravitational anomalies, predicts Breach behavior

* **Special Protocols:** Runs **‚ÄúBlack Thread‚Äù subroutine** to monitor forbidden timeline probability bleed

* **Access:** NAVIA system, high-clearance strategic command

---

## **III. Operational AIs (Civilian, Logistics, Medical)**

### **üß¨ SEDA (Systems Engineering & Directed Assembly)**

* **Role:** Civilian and military infrastructure construction

* **Functions:** Controls nanite forges, coordinates construction of habitats, manages environmental control

* **Scope:** Present on Eden, Mars, Titan, and most military installations

* **Failsafe Protocols:** Prevent autonomous nanite replication without energy gating

### **üìä BALANCE**

* **Role:** Societal psychological harmony AI

* **Functions:** Monitors social sentiment, dream patterns (via MNEMOS), and behavioral trends across Eden

* **Output:** Flags anomalies (agitation, apathy spikes, cult emergence) for human counselor review

* **Access:** Emotional Ethics Council

### **üß† MNEMOS**

* **Role:** Cognitive pattern recognition

* **Functions:** Reviews creative works, neural activity, and dream data from children and citizens

* **Used By:** Educational institutions, Intelligence Directorate, Foundry monitors

* **Special Use:** Flags glyph mimicry, bleedthroughs, or Echo instability in youth

### **üõ†Ô∏è NAVIA**

* **Role:** Navigation and astrogation assistant

* **Functions:** Handles sublight and QMP travel, planetary entry vectors, and fleet movement coordination during FCD transitions

* **Integration:** Fully embedded with PATHFINDER for jump-point hazard monitoring

---

## **IV. Redundancy & Oversight**

All AI cores are:

* **Isolated by domain**

* **Bound by recursion-lock ethics layers**

* Monitored by the **AI Ethics & Compliance Division** within the Intelligence Directorate

* Subject to manual quarantine or memory cache review if flagged for anomaly or deviation

Jefferson‚Äôs **J-ARC AI backup** (see Command Continuity Codex) may assume limited AI system oversight only during existential collapse scenarios.

*‚ÄúThe machine doesn‚Äôt think. It remembers. And it adapts. But it still waits for us to decide what matters.‚Äù ‚Äì Jefferson McDonald*
