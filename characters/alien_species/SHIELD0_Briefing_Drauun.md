# 🛡️ SHIELD-0 Briefing Report – Dra’uun (Designation: EVER-REMEMBERING)

**Prepared By:** Pathfinder Intelligence Cell Theta-9  
**Clearance Level:** DELTA-BLACK  
**Circulation:** JEFFERSON Oversight | RAU Core | Echo Integrity Board

---

## 📍 Species Identifier
**Name:** Dra’uun  
**EDF Codename:** Ever-Remembering  
**Origin:** Vaskel – Methane-rich Super-Earth, High Gravity (217 Light Years)  
**Estimated Age of Civilizational Development:** 46,000–50,000 Years  
**DNA Compatibility:** ~81% overlap with Homo sapiens (convergent seeding theory)

---

## 📜 Memory Doctrine Summary
- The Dra’uun retain **perfect memory** from birth. No forgetting, no abstraction.
- Collective memory cores are physically embedded within their ships, cities, and even genetic encoding.
- Allegory, symbolism, and speculative fiction are absent from their culture.
- “Forgetting” is an act of spiritual euthanasia, performed only at death.

---

## 🧠 Cognitive Risks
- Contact with Dra’uun memory transmission systems may result in:
  - **Synaptic overload** in Echo-born operatives
  - **Pattern fixation** in AI constructs (VANTA-class units are especially vulnerable)
  - **Recursive identity drift** in unshielded humans—resulting in traumatic memory echo loops

## 🚀 Technological Overview
| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| Propulsion | Gravity-anchored pulse accelerators, beacon-guided interstellar gates |
| Weaponry | Graviton projectors, mass driver batteries, memory field disruptors |
| Command | Neural-linked memory clusters, redundancy over optimization |
| Defense | Armor layered in memory-encoded alloys; failsafes triggered by recursion detection |

### Notable Vessels:
- **Nugget / Witness** – Observation drones with full data fidelity  
- **Bulwark / Archivist** – Memory-core cruisers  
- **Keystone / Citadel** – Mobile historical vaults & strategic command centers

## ⚠️ Threat Assessment

| Category | Risk | SHIELD-0 Notes |
|----------|------|----------------|
| Conflict Potential | 🔺 High | Will not initiate but respond with overwhelming force to perceived recursion |
| Memory Warfare | 🔺 Critical | Human tactics matching known patterns may trigger preemptive engagement |
| Diplomatic Exposure | ⚠️ Medium | Open to discussion but incapable of emotional intuition; misunderstand metaphor and intent |
| Technological Drift | ⚠️ High | Long exposure to Dra’uun tech may leave human personnel permanently altered cognitively |

## 🛑 SHIELD-0 Directive

**Engagement Class:**  
- RAU/SHIELD-0 Only  
- No unsanctioned AI interface  
- Full neural shielding for Echo-class operatives

**Operational Orders:**
- Do not repeat tactical patterns within the same session
- No direct uplink to memory lattice fields without JEFFERSON override
- Avoid exposing Dra’uun observers to human historical records
