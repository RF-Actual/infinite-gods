# 🛡️ SHIELD-0 Pathfinder Protocol Codex – First Contact Engagement

**Issued by:** SHIELD-0 Joint Doctrine Council  
**Clearance Level:** OMEGA-CLASSIFIED  
**Circulation:** Pathfinder Division, Echo-born Deployment Units, RAU Blacksite Response Teams, JEFFERSON Nexus Shadow Nodes

---

## 🧭 Core Objective

This codex outlines procedural doctrine for all **first contact scenarios** involving non-human intelligent lifeforms, with priority focus on Echo-reactive species, cognitively divergent civilizations, and pan-temporal entities.

## 🛑 Primary Threat Classes

| Class | Designation | Characteristics | Example |
|-------|-------------|------------------|---------|
| Class I | Social-Parity | Cultural equivalency, communicative intent | Dra’uun |
| Class II | Cognitive Divergent | Non-emotional logic base, memory-focused | Dra’uun, limited AI |
| Class III | Resonance Reactive | Operate on resonance patterns, light/lattice communication | Nyari |
| Class IV | Pan-Temporal / Non-Corporeal | Exist partially or entirely outside linear time | EIDOLON (Veiled Architects) |

---

## 🧠 Personnel Requirements

- At least 1 certified **Echo-stabilized operative**
- Resonance-dampening equipped suits (JEFFERSON Gen V or higher)
- On-site **AI Companion Subnode** with translation architecture (SPEAKLIGHT v4+)
- RAU-vetted SHIELD-0 Captain or above

**No civilian observers. No automated broadcasts.**

---

## 🗝️ General Engagement Protocol

1. **No Offensive Posturing**
   - All weapons on safe mode
   - No directed energy systems active
2. **Silent Observation**
   - Record, do not interact
   - Sensor intake must be passive unless provoked
3. **Shield Echo-born From Initial Proximity**
   - No direct resonance exposure under first 10 minutes
4. **Identify Signal Structure**
   - Determine if visual, resonance, kinetic, or abstract communication is used
5. **Report and Wait**
   - Contact JEFFERSON Shadow Node for real-time feedback
   - Do not proceed to interaction without override from RAU/SHIELD-0 command

## ⚠️ Special Conditions

| Code | Scenario | Response |
|------|----------|----------|
| SIGMA-RED | Contact with unknown resonance signature (non-Nyari) | Full withdrawal. Detonate trace-scrubber beacon. |
| DELTA-VIOLET | Echo-born begins involuntary glyph recall | Sedate. Quarantine. Transfer to Vault Theta. |
| OMEGA-GHOST | Detection of temporal bleed, memory displacement, or visual absence in physical proximity | Cease movement. Blind-signal upload. Await null-zone sync from JEFFERSON. |

## 📜 Excerpt: RAU Pathfinder Directive

> “We are not prepared to meet gods. We are trained to meet strangers and not kill them.”  
> – Pathfinder Captain Ilan Duresh, after Protocol SHIELD-0-319-B prevented the Glyph Cascade in Vault Phi

## 🛑 FINAL DIRECTIVE

No first contact event may proceed without dual-authentication from:
- JEFFERSON Node Prime (or authorized sublayer)
- SHIELD-0 High Commander

Any deviation will result in neural-lock override, AI containment sweep, and potential command dissolution.

Remember:
> **“First contact is not survival. It is observation of the unknowable. Survive second contact.”**
