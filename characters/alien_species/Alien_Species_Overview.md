# 👽 Alien Species Overview – Infinite Gods Codex

## Summary
This document provides a high-level overview of confirmed intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations currently monitored or diplomatically engaged by the Echo Directorate, SHIELD-0, and RAU.

## 🌐 Species Index

| Species | Homeworld | Distance | First Contact | Human DNA Match | Temperament | EDF Threat Rating | SHIELD-0 Status |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------------|------------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Nyari** | Tenara | ~40.1 ly | 2 years post-Reset | 87.2% | Cautiously non-aggressive | Amber (Anomalous) | Monitored: Light-Resonant Species |
| **Dra’uun** | Vaskel | ~217 ly | Pre-Reset (observation only) | ~81% | Memory-rigid, unpredictable under recursion | Red (Latent-Strategic) | Monitored: Memory-Locked Civilization |

---

## 🔬 Shared Biological Traits

- Both species share significant segments of DNA with Homo sapiens, suggesting Alpha Prime resonance-seeding or panspermia convergence.
- Both evolved environmental cognitive divergences: **Nyari via resonance and light**, **Dra’uun via gravity adaptation and total memory fidelity**.

## 🧠 Psychological Distinctions

| Category | Nyari | Dra’uun |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Core Paradigm | Harmony through resonance | Continuity through memory |
| Communication | Bioluminescent pulse-lattice | Direct memory-linked consensus |
| Conflict Response | Disarmament via harmonic dampening | Total recall-based warfare |
| Art/Expression | Abstract waveforms, songlight sculptures | Historical fractal encoding |

## 🚀 Technological Focus

| Domain | Nyari | Dra’uun |
|--------|-------|---------|
| FTL Travel | Harmonic folding (resonance navigation) | Memory-beacon gate paths |
| Offensive Systems | Resonance field manipulation | Gravity-based projection + cognitive interference |
| Ship Structure | Organic/living constructs | Dense, reinforced gravity-hardened megastructures |
| Key Vessel | “Grove” / “Cathedral” | “Keystone” / “Citadel” |
