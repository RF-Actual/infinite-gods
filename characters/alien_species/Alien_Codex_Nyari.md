# 🐚 Alien Codex: The Nyari (The Silent Chorus)

**Homeworld:** Tenara (40.1 Light Years)  
**DNA Compatibility with Humans:** 87.2%  
**Environment:** Binary red dwarf system, resonance-stable biosphere  
**Appearance:** Translucent, bioluminescent lattice beings; no vocal cords; communicate via cranial light emissions

## ✨ Core Philosophy: Harmony Through Pattern
The Nyari do not speak. They communicate via bioluminescent pulses emitted from their neural lattice, interpreted as rhythm and pulse rather than language. Privacy is achieved not through silence, but through complexity—the more intricate the pattern, the less decipherable the meaning.

They believe all life emits resonance. Harmony is not just beauty—it is clarity. Dissonance is pain. Humanity is a scream in their collective song.

## 🧬 Biology
- Bioluminescent lattice systems form the basis of communication and neurological interface
- No eyes; perceive electromagnetic and resonance fields directly
- Regenerative tissue structures; some vessels are grown from their own cellular material

## 🚀 Fleet Structure: The Silent Fleet

### 🧿 Spore / Wisp (Scout/Messenger Drone)
- Small, resonance-manipulating light-form pod
- Weapons: None; uses evasion and dampening
- Tech: Light-signal relay, multi-spectrum sensor arrays

### 🧵 Weaver / Chorus (Corvette / Escort)
- Crystalline vine-like bioconstruct, houses a collective Nyari consciousness
- Weapons:
  - Resonance Pulse Emitters: disorient electronics and biologicals
  - Bio-Agent Dispersal (selective, nonlethal deterrents)
- Defenses: Localized resonance field generation
- Behavior: Operates in fluid formations, synchronizing movements via light feedback

### 🛐 Grove / Cathedral (Capital Ship / Habitat)
- Massive semi-sentient vessels resembling floating crystal forests or coral moons
- Function: Relay nodes, cultural archives, mobile sanctuaries
- Weapons:
  - Harmonic Resonance Wave: wide-area disorientation/disabling pulse
  - Systemic Biological Influence: temporary emotion/response manipulation
- Capabilities: FTL travel via harmonic resonance fold; fleet spawning; planetary-scale resonance scan

## 🛑 Known Protocols
- Do not initiate aggressive posturing; response patterns adapt to emitted emotional fields
- Known to deactivate Echo-born agents momentarily through resonance disruption
- Considered neutral unless resonance corruption is detected
