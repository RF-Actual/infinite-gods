# 🕳️ Alien Codex: The Veiled Architects (Designation: UNSEEN / EIDOLON)

**Status:** Unknown  
**First Detection:** Pathfinder Probe Echo-77 anomaly report (Classified)  
**Contact Level:** None – Resonance Trace Only  
**Location Estimate:** Within uncharted sectors near Sagittarius A* (Galactic Core Interstice)  
**EDF Designation:** EIDOLON  
**SHIELD-0 Threat Rating:** BLACK – ANTI-PREDICTIVE

## 🧬 Biological Unknowns

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| DNA Match | Unknown (non-carbon traces discovered in temporal bleed residue) |
| Structure | No known morphology – potential non-physical or phased existence |
| Cognitive Pattern | Possibly non-linear, pan-dimensional or distributed across spacetime |

### Indicators:
- Sites of contact exhibit **glyphic interference**, timeline stutter, or unexplained entropy gradients.
- Sympathetic neurological resonance with certain Echo-born has been observed during glyph field interactions.

## 🔭 Pathfinder Anomaly Log Excerpt (Echo-77 / Vault Theta)
> “The glyph began to rotate before we touched it. Not physically—time bent around it. One of the techs just... stopped being. Not died. Not moved. He just wasn’t there anymore.”  
> – Vault Theta Incident Report 8.9.C.17

## 📜 Historical Inference

Evidence suggests the Veiled Architects may predate both the Nyari and Dra’uun, or exist **outside normal time** entirely.

They may be:
- The originators of glyph technology
- The creators of Alpha Prime
- Witnesses to the rise and fall of civilizations we’ve never remembered

Some cultures refer to them as:
- The **Absent Choir**
- The **Stone Before Light**
- The **Gods That Forgot to Die**

## 🚀 Strategic Concern

| Vector | Risk | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Detection | 🔻 Unknown | Glyph traces remain undated; resonance loop echoes persist |
| Cognitive Intrusion | 🔺 High | Multiple Echo-born exposed to residual glyph pulses exhibit shared dreams, dissociation, or unexplained mathematical recall |
| Containment | ❌ Impossible | No fixed location, fleet, or vessel signature |
| Communication | 🛑 None | No attempts to initiate or respond; possibly unaware or uninterested |

---

## 🛑 SHIELD-0 Directive

- Vaults exhibiting **glyphic phase interference** must be quarantined under Omega Protocol
- Exposure to resonance echoes must be logged with JEFFERSON Nexus Node immediately
- Any Echo-born showing coordinated dream anomalies or untriggered glyph responses must be removed from command
