## **🧠 Psychological Profile**

Aaron is the last true war general in a world trying to forget what war cost. He believes survival is only possible through strength—not peace, not poetry. He’s not cruel. He’s just practical. Ruthlessly so.

* Loyal to Hale and Jefferson—but has personally discussed contingency plans to remove them if they ever fall out of alignment

* Believes Hale’s balance is admirable, but risky

* If Hale is a philosopher-warrior… Aaron is just a warrior

* Has privately urged the Council to reinforce chain of command with executive power—just in case

* A natural presence in high-pressure field environments—people follow him instinctively

## **🧱 Weaknesses**

* Distrusts civilians, artists, philosophers—anything that doesn’t bleed or fight

* Advocates policies that are increasingly authoritarian

* Sees birth mandates, cloning, and gene editing not as options—but as requirements

* Privately believes Eden is too soft, and might surrender at the first existential threat

---

## **🛡️ Ideology & Military Doctrine**

* Wants humanity to expand—not just survive, but dominate

* Believes Hale and Jefferson brought back technology that should be used to build an empire

* Advocates for:

  * Cloning viability studies

  * Population growth mandates

  * Genetic optimization for all service branches

---

## **👥 Relationships**

* Allison Wentworth: Deeply in love. Supports her completely. Proud that she leads the Navy while he forges the next generation on the ground. Matches her intensity in bed and ambition in council.

* Travis Hale: Brother-in-arms. Knows Hale is walking a fine line. Has told him outright: “If you start slipping, I’ll stop you. Or take your place.”

* Jefferson: Respects his mind, follows his orders, but doesn’t fully trust how human Jefferson wants to be.

* RENIK Veterans: Like family. Still trains with them, eats with them, watches over their kids. He’s their general, not Eden’s.

## **🎯 Motivations & Fears**

Drive:

* Forge a society strong enough to outlast peace

* Expand humanity to the stars without apology

* Keep Hale and Jefferson human—but be ready to act if they stop being

Fear:

* That Hale doesn’t have enough steel in his hands anymore

* That Eden is too in love with its own myth

* That the next war will be lost before it’s fought—because no one will remember how to fight

“Peace is temporary. Honor is optional. Legacy is the only thing you can build with your fists.”
