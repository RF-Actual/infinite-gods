## **🧠 Psychological Profile**

Survivor. Executioner. Icon. Mother. Yasmine was forged in the siege of Mariupol and reborn in the collapse of Bakhmut. Her fame during the Ukraine War made her a symbol of resistance. Jefferson preserved her—now Eden relies on her. But she has never forgiven the world that let her burn.

* Cold to strangers, loyal to death once trust is earned

* Suffers from night terrors, near-total distrust of institutions

* Weaponized emotional distance, until it comes to her children

* She trusts only three people: Travis, Maya, and Maya’s future self

---

## **💪 Strengths**

* Tactical intuition nearly on par with Travis

* Close-quarters combat and field improvisation expert

* Peak combat readiness at all times—her only religion is preparation

* Unflinching during Echo Drift events; described as “anchored” by RAU medics

## **🧱 Weaknesses**

* Struggles with soft leadership or mentorship

* Loathes public mythologizing of her past

* Harbors jealousy toward Lillian, and remains cold toward Jefferson

* Has never fully unpacked what happened in Vault Theta

---

## **🧬 Echo & Resonance Traits**

* High Echo-reactivity; exhibits anticipatory reflex spikes

* Documented to emit “resonance shielding” during Maya’s traumatic awakenings

* Glyph scans show she is “harmonically stable” when touching Travis or Maya

* Known to instinctively track timeline variance without being conscious of it

---

## **👥 Relationships**

* Travis Hale: Passionate, war-forged bond. He steadies her. She sharpens him. Their private life is the one space she feels real in. They try for more children—never succeed.

* Maya Hale: Her light. Her fear. Yasmine watches her with love and terror. She doesn’t fear Maya hurting the world—she fears the world breaking Maya.

* Silas & Stellan: Protective, but less emotionally intimate than Travis. She trains them. Hard. She does not tell bedtime stories—she gives them war games.

* Jefferson: Uneasy. She owes him survival, but resents how much of herself he re-wrote to get her here. She never calls him by name.

* Allison Wentworth: Cold, combative history. Mutual respect on the battlefield. Off-mission, they say as little as possible.

---

## **📚 Habits & Personal Life**

* Trains with real blades at night—repetition calms her

* Keeps a lockbox of items from Ukraine she never opens

* Refuses nanite sleep enhancement, says dreams are where she fights

* Keeps a notebook she writes in daily but burns pages from weekly

* Hates surveillance. Knows where every node is in Eden

---

## **🎯 Motivations & Fears**

Drive:

* Build a world where Maya doesn’t need to become what she was

* Never allow Eden to become soft, complacent, or corrupted

* Be more than a symbol—be the blade that enforces the future

Fear:

* That she is no longer human enough to raise children in peace

* That Maya will need to do worse things than Yasmine ever did

* That Travis will fade from her one day—not from death, but from guilt
