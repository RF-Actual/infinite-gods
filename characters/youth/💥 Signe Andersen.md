# **💥 Signe Andersen**

*“She can calculate the minimum breaching charge needed to destroy a wall—and then doubles it because it’s more fun that way.”*

---

## **🧍 Appearance**

* **Age:** 6

* **Height:** 4'2"

* **Hair:** Platinum blonde, braided in tactical coils by her mother

* **Eyes:** Steely blue, analytical and always processing

* **Skin:** Pale with freckles across the nose and cheeks

* **Style:** Standard youth cadet outfit, but her boots are modified for uneven terrain and always scuffed from climbing things she shouldn’t

---

## **🧠 Personality**

* Quiet, but never uncertain

* Speaks in clear, calculated bursts—when she talks, you *listen*

* Prefers numbers to arguments, action to speeches

* Never asks *if* something can be done—only *how*

---

## **📐 Strengths**

* Advanced spatial reasoning and geometry

* Top of her class in chemistry and structural physics

* Mentally models breaching scenarios like others draw stick figures

* Excellent under pressure—responds to conflict with analysis, not panic

---

## **⚠️ Weaknesses**

* Has a tendency to *overdesign* or *overcalculate*—just to be sure

* Sometimes distant during emotional group moments—she sees grief or tension as equations to solve

* Doesn't fully understand why kids "just guess" instead of running the numbers

---

## **🎮 Hobbies & Leadership Traits**

* Designs obstacle courses using scavenged items and “borrowed” gear

* Organizes assault simulations with the other kids—“Omnivault Defense” is her favorite game

* Loves team-based hide and seek with breacher roles, medics, and sentries

* Not a spotlight-seeker, but other kids follow her plans without question

---

## **🏗️ Family Legacy**

* **Father:** Nils “Bricks” Andersen – explosive entry expert and RENIK breacher

  * She wants to break into something harder than he ever has

* **Mother:** Elsa Andersen – lead Eden structural engineer

  * Has taught Signe to respect integrity before force—but Signe *doubles the charge anyway*

---

## **💬 Sample Dialogue**

“If you want a clean breach, I can do the math. But if you want to make *them* scared on the other side? Add two more bricks of compound. That’ll get their attention.”

---

## **🚀 Potential**

* SOCOM breacher? She’ll rewrite the manuals.

* Combat engineer? She’ll build bunkers strong enough to outlast the stars.

* Or both—because nobody told her she can’t.
