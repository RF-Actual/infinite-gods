# **Jude Wentworth**

*“If you tell him he can’t do it, he’ll try twice as hard—and throw something on his way out.”*

---

## **🧍 Appearance**

* **Age:** 6

* **Height:** 4'3"

* **Hair:** Chestnut brown, wild and unbrushed no matter what Allison does

* **Eyes:** Piercing green with just enough scowl to worry teachers

* **Skin:** Tanned like his father—constantly scraped from running, climbing, crashing

* **Style:** Wears what he wants—often mismatched. Tactical boots and cartoon shirts. Has a favorite jacket that’s two sizes too big because it “feels like armor”

---

## **🔥 Personality**

* Loud. Emotional. Unfiltered.

* Doesn’t want to lead—wants to *win*

* Craves independence, resists instruction, and will argue with a fence post if it says “no”

* Loves big, hates big, forgives fast, and forgets nothing

---

## **🧠 Strengths**

* **Resilient:** Falls down, gets up harder

* **Creative:** Comes up with unconventional solutions—sometimes brilliant, sometimes explosive

* **Empathic:** Senses when others are upset, even if he doesn’t know how to help

---

## **⚠️ Weaknesses**

* **Jealousy:** Especially toward Kieran—*why does he always know the answer?*

* **Impulse control:** Doesn’t have it. Might throw a rock before thinking of a word

* **Feeling overlooked:** Youngest in the line of legends—*he knows it*

---

## **🛠 Habits & Hobbies**

* Builds “traps” around the family quarters—some of them even work

* Loves climbing, sneaking into rooms he’s not supposed to be in

* Secretly writes stories where *he’s* the hero—“Jude the Brave” vs. monsters no one else sees

* Collects things—bits of metal, glyph fragments, feathers—calls them “proof of weird stuff”

---

## **👥 Family Ties**

* **Kieran:**

  * Sees him as a rival, not a brother

  * Thinks he’s “too good to be real”—and he’s not wrong

  * Wants to beat him at something—*anything*

* **Cassia:**

  * Big sister, bossy, annoyingly right

  * She protects him like a mama hawk with talons out

  * They argue nonstop—but if anyone else messes with him? She’s there

* **Allison:**

  * Doesn’t want to disappoint her—but doesn’t want to be her either

  * Thinks her flight suit is the coolest thing on the planet

  * Sometimes asks her if she loves him as much as Kieran—then runs before she answers

* **Aaron:**

  * Scares him a little—like a mountain with eyes

  * Wants to be tough like him, but not like him

  * Trains hard to impress him, even when he acts like he doesn’t care

---

## **🎯 Motivations**

* Prove he belongs

* Win at something on his own terms

* Make someone say, “Good job, Jude”—without it sounding like they were surprised

---

“He might not lead armies. But you want him on your team when you’re pinned down and scared. Because Jude? Jude doesn’t quit.”
