\# 🌟 Eden Youth Cadre Codex

\> \*"The children of Eden carry not just our hopes—but the echoes of our failures, and the resonance of all futures yet unwritten."\*

\---

\#\# 📚 Purpose

This section archives the full personnel dossiers for the Eden Youth Cohort—children born or raised under the guidance of Echo and Resonance after the Reset.    
Each profile contains key traits, tactical potential, psychological tendencies, and familial legacy.

These are not ordinary children.    
They are the next architects—or the next rebels—of Eden’s fate.
