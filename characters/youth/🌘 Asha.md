# **🌘 Asha**

*“She dreams of places no one’s seen. She draws symbols no one taught her. And she listens for things most people can’t hear.”*

---

## **🧍 Appearance**

* **Age:** 7

* **Height:** 4'3"

* **Hair:** Deep black, worn in a tight braid or buzzed sides with cyber-etches (depending on mood)

* **Eyes:** Black-brown, almost ink—absorbing light instead of reflecting it

* **Skin:** Rich brown, with faint resonance tracer lines under the surface (visible during scans)

* **Style:** Plain, functional clothes with hidden circuit embroidery; she modifies everything she wears to contain signal jacks, glyph traces, or grounding loops

---

## **🧠 Personality**

* Quiet. Observant. Not shy—but cautious

* Rarely speaks unless spoken to, but when she does, it’s surgical

* Has a deeply analytical mind, with a strange emotional detachment from her peers

* Feels deeply for people—but doesn’t *connect* easily

---

## **🧬 Anomalous Traits**

* Echo-reactive: RAU has flagged her for **resonance anomalies**

* She dreams of ruins that don’t exist, timelines no one remembers

* Untrained glyph sensitivity: she’s drawn sigils that match pre-reset Echo tech ruins *she’s never seen*

* Bio-monitors spike during Maya or Orin’s Echo flare events—even when she’s not present

---

## **🎮 Hobbies & Behavior**

* Modifies her own neural input systems

* Can “hear” when the network latency across Eden shifts—tunes into signal resonance patterns for comfort

* Draws symbols and structures, sometimes in trance states

* Watches the stars not with wonder, but *recognition*

---

## **👪 Family**

* **Adoptive Parents:**

  * **Splice:** SIGINT warfare expert, precision thinker

  * **Reed:** Quantum linguist, network systems interface specialist

  * Together, they adopted Asha not because they wanted a child, but because Asha *found them*

* Her parents are protective—but curious. They document her behaviors like researchers, but love her like family

---

## **🎯 Personality Summary**

* Possibly the most dangerous unknown variable among the Eden youth

* She’s not angry. She’s not reckless. She’s not even afraid

* She’s just *waiting* for something no one else can feel—but she *knows* it’s coming

“I didn’t make up the symbol. I just remembered it.”
