# **⚔️ War Plans Codex – Eden Defense Contingency Doctrine**

This codex defines the strategic defense posture, fallback protocols, and war planning capabilities of the Eden Defense Force (EDF) in the event of a full-spectrum peer-level conflict or direct planetary assault on Eden itself.

---

## **I. Strategic Design Philosophy**

Eden was not built as a utopia first—it was built as a **bastion**.

* Hale’s principle: **Distributed lethality**—every city, bunker, and mountain must serve a role in war.

* Jefferson’s principle: **Embedded defense logic**—core AI systems can activate defense protocols even without higher command.

**If Eden falls, the war is already lost. So Eden must never fall.**

## **II. Planetary Defense Architecture**

### **A. Orbital Defense Layer**

| System | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| **ODP-90 “Aureole” Platforms** | Network of 15–20 high-orbit platforms equipped with Breach Lances, plasma arrays, and point-defense AI targeting suites |
| **Sentinel Net (Micro-Orbitals)** | Thousands of autonomous kinetic kill satellites managed by SENTINEL AI for real-time anti-missile and anti-drop defense |
| **Interceptor Ghost Wings** | Fully automated squadrons of Echo-class drone fighters, ready for rapid launch and FCD interception |

### **B. Anti-FCD Defense Grid**

* **Atmospheric Scrambler Arrays**: Disrupt inbound Fold-Compression Drive (FCD) entries within upper atmosphere

* **Graviton Wake Distortion Fields**: Create controlled resonance turbulence over high-risk zones to prevent pinpoint FCD insertions

* **STAG-Red Enclaves** (Classified): Emergency lockdown zones capable of triggering regional EMP curtains and local resonance suppression fields in case of confirmed breach or glyph activity

### **C. Planetary Surface Defenses**

| Region | Primary Assets |
| ----- | ----- |
| **North America / Eden Prime** | Omega Bastion (buried fortress, triple-fusion grid powering railgun and Graviton Torpedo silos) |
| **African Shield Zone** | Solar-anchored directed energy platforms, atmospheric mirror arrays |
| **Eurasian Ridge Zones** | AI-controlled drone hive bunkers, sub-surface missile nests, mobile walker divisions |
| **Oceanic Blacklines** | Cloaked deep-sea launch platforms, Atlas-class missile vaults |

## **III. Personnel & Tactical Readiness**

* **Active Garrison Forces**: \~6 million EDF Marines and Navy stationed planet-side, with reserves housed in modular training cities

* **Civilian Defense Network (CDN)**:

  * Embedded drone swarms in urban architecture

  * Instant-response nanite trauma centers

  * Environmental lockdown systems (smart cities convert to bunkered grid)

* **Command Continuity Protocols**:

  * If both Hale and Jefferson are incapacitated, Omega Override initiates:

    * AI gains strategic autonomy

    * STAG authorization for full-spectrum retaliation

    * Unseals Chimera battalions and blacksite reserves

## **IV. Eden Defense Timeline (Without Fleet Support)**

| Phase | Duration | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Phase I: Initial Assault** | Week 0–2 | Aureole platforms engage, civilian lockdown begins, STAG recon launches |
| **Phase II: Orbital Containment** | Week 3–6 | Interceptors and Sentinel Net hold sky; ground AA assets fully activated |
| **Phase III: Attritional Hold** | Week 7–12+ | Cities become fortresses, automated factories shift to full wartime production |
| **Fleet ETA (Best Case)** | \~6–10 weeks | If fleet receives distress and executes FCD return from outer system or Breach front |

**Without fleet return, Eden’s defenses hold for \~4–5 months.**

## **V. Total War Simulation: 4-Year Peer Conflict**

| Year | EDF KIA | EDF Replacements | Net Force Status |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Y1 | \~9 million | \~11.5 million | Slightly reduced, stabilizing via recall |
| Y2 | \~6.5 million | \~12 million | Rebuilt to \~45M active troops |
| Y3 | \~5.2 million | \~13 million | Growth to \~50M+ total strength |
| Y4 | \~4.1 million | \~13.5 million | **Peak Force: 52–54M+** |

**Fleet, armor, and drone recovery fully restored by Year 4** using nanite forges at Titan, Luna, and Mars Orbital.

**Enemy force collapses under logistical strain, timeline instability, and internal fracturing.**

---

## **VI. Decisive Victory Factor**

* Eden outlasts, out-produces, and out-integrates its enemy through:

  * Strategic sustainability

  * Cultural durability

  * Superior AI command support

  * Long-term logistics and population planning

*“You don’t win by striking first. You win by being the last thing standing.” – General Aaron Wentworth*

---

## **VII. Colony Defense & War Resilience Codex – Off-Earth Strategic Nodes**

### **Mars – Ares Prime Arcology**

* 750k EDF garrison, 1.2M civilian militia

* Orbital and planetary railgun defenses

* Can hold 8–10 months under siege

### **Titan – Hephaestus Station**

* Industrial nanite forge center

* Self-sustained, autonomous for 3+ years

* If orbital defense fails, collapses in 6–8 weeks

### **Europa – Oceanus Hub**

* RAU/data vault

* Will not survive full assault; 2–4 week collapse timeline

### **Ganymede / Callisto Black Corridors**

* STAG observation nodes

* Self-destruct protocols upon breach

Titan or Mars must survive for Eden to endure

---

## **VIII. Titan Continuity Protocol Codex – Project SCATTERFORGE**

* Secret fallback nanite forge: **Minerva Station** (Neptune Trojan L5)

* Activated via neural interface (Jefferson or Aaron Wentworth only)

* Autonomous, cloaked, capable of 30–40% Titan output

* Emergency activation triggers AI package redeployment, cryogenic crew thaw, stealth QMP supply runs

* Public cover story: "Subsurface Power Surge at Titan"

*“We build what we pray we never need. And bury it where only ghosts would look.” – Jefferson McDonald*
