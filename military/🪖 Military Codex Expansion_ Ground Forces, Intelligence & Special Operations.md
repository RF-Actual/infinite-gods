## **A. Marine Corps (Planetary Operations Command)**

### **🔰 Mandate**

* Planetary assault

* Shipboard combat/security

* Colony and installation defense

* Rapid reaction force across multiple environments (zero-G, subterranean, hostile atmospheres)

**Commanded by General Aaron Wentworth**

### **🛡️ Core Unit Structure: Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU)**

* **Ground Combat Element (GCE):**

  * Battalion Landing Team (BLT)

  * 10-Marine squads → Platoons → Companies → Battalions

  * Includes heavy weapons teams (AMR-1, PL-2), engineers, NCF operators

* **Air Combat Element (ACE):**

  * ASF-11 “Echo” fighters, AH-9 “Fury” gunships, UD-7 “Harbinger” drop ships

* **Logistics Combat Element (LCE):**

  * Nanite-assisted repair, medics, mobile supply chain, field engineering

### **🎓 Training Pipeline**

* **Basic:** Earth orbit \+ Mars-based vacuum and zero-G training

* **Advanced:** Mars garrison (Ares Prime), anomaly simulation, combined arms drills

* **Command Track:** Tactical AI interface ops, leadership under fire, neural reinforcement

### **⚙️ NCF Integration**

* Standard issue across GCE

* HUD-linked to TACTICUS, WHISPER

* Enhances endurance, recoil absorption, and situational data relay

### **🛠️ Specialized Divisions**

* **Recon/Sniper Platoons:** Long-range, stealth, anomaly zone recon

* **Breacher Teams:** Urban, ship, and station ingress assault

* **Raider Companies:** Deep insertion, high-speed strike operations

## **B. Intelligence Directorate (ID)**

### **🧠 Mandate**

* Threat analysis, anomaly detection, internal security, long-term forecasting

* Reports to Defense Council

**Headed by Director (Civilian or Naval Intel Officer)**

### **🛰️ Divisions**

* **SIGINT/EW:** QEB analysis, comms surveillance, encryption breaking

  * Includes Splice and Reed

* **HUMINT/CI:** Sedition investigations, external agent tracking, internal loyalty monitoring

* **Resonance Analysis Unit (RAU):**

  * Uses PATHFINDER data and exotic sensors

  * No Glyph knowledge—identifies disturbances, not causes

  * Classifies anomaly severity

* **Strategic Analysis & Threat Assessment (SATA):**

  * Threat forecasting, planetary risk maps, alien intelligence modeling

### **🔒 Security Measures**

* Layered data compartmentalization

* Decentralized QEB encryption

* Redundant AI threat models

---

## **C. Special Operations Command (SOCOM \- “RENIK Legacy”)**

### **🕶️ Mandate**

* High-risk, classified missions requiring unique skillsets

* Oversees anomaly containment, direct action, hostage recovery, and unconventional warfare

**Under Wentworth with dedicated SOCOM Commander (e.g., Rook)**

### **🧱 Core Units**

* **FORTs (Forward Observation & Response Teams):**

  * Successors to Jackknife/Corvus

  * 4–8 operator cells, anomaly containment, deep recon, personnel recovery

* **STAG (Strategic Threat & Apprehension Group):**

  * Handles internal blacksite breaches, espionage suppression, political risk neutralization

  * Ghost Protocol-tier ops

* **TechOps (Technical Operations Support):**

  * EW, AI warfare, advanced breaching, infiltration, medical

  * Includes Splice, Reed, Gauge, Bricks

### **🎯 Equipment**

* Custom NCFs, stealth coatings, high-sensitivity multi-spectrum sensors

* Non-lethal and specialized breach gear

* Blacksite extraction ships, stealth drop shuttles

### **⚖️ Oversight**

* Defense Council-authorized deployments

* Direct Intel \+ Marine command cross-briefs

* Enforced blackout protocols, restricted post-op debriefs
