## **‚öîÔ∏è PRIMARY ANTI-SHIP SYSTEMS (CAPITAL SHIPS)**

| Weapon System | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Resonance Torpedoes** | High-yield spacetime disruptors. Limited, devastating. Bypass shields via quantum destabilization of local Resonance Fields. Requires advanced target-locking AI and Echo-class operator clearance. |
| **Heavy Plasma Rail Cannons** | Magnetically accelerated plasma bolts or kinetic slugs. High damage to shields and armor. Fire rate limited by energy cycle buildup. Mainline artillery across most Dreadnought and Super Dreadnought classes. |
| **Breach Lances** | Close-range, shield-piercing energy projectors. Focused, surgical application of heat and force. Used for ship dissection or critical system breaching at reduced distance. |

## **üéØ SECONDARY / SUPPORT WEAPON SYSTEMS**

### **Modular Missile Batteries**

* **Kinetic Penetrators** ‚Äì High-density, high-velocity impact slugs.

* **Plasma Warheads** ‚Äì AOE thermal detonation; anti-squadron or soft-structure.

* **EMP Charges** ‚Äì Electronic disruption and sensor blackout.

* **Lesser Resonance Charges** ‚Äì Disrupt local fields, confuse tracking and shields.

* **Hypervelocity Missiles** ‚Äì Minimal payload, extreme speed; evade point-defense.

### **Fighter / Bomber Wings**

* **Echo-Class Fighters** ‚Äì Trans-atmospheric superiority craft; AI-enhanced dogfighting.

* **Tempest-Class Bombers** ‚Äì Torpedo and heavy ordnance delivery; slow but armored.

## **üõ°Ô∏è POINT DEFENSE SYSTEMS (MULTI-LAYERED)**

| System | Role |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Directed Energy Weapons (DEW)** | Particle beams and lasers for precision missile and small craft intercepts. |
| **Kinetic Networks** | AI-controlled rail-needle clouds. Forms lethal anti-ordnance barrier. Short-range. Autonomous or operator-augmented. |

## **‚òÑÔ∏è ORBITAL STRIKE SYSTEMS**

* **Capital-class Plasma Rail Cannons** ‚Äì Capable of ground strike using sub-relativistic mass. Targets must be visible and confirmed‚Äîused with caution under ROE.
