# **🗃️ Historical Archives Codex – Infinite Gods Universe**

This codex defines the fragmented preservation, suppression, and controlled curation of pre-Reset human history. It outlines what Eden’s citizens remember, what remains hidden, and how the truth of the old world is managed in myth, policy, and memory.

## **I. Survivor Memory & Cognitive Disparity**

### **🧠 Memory Retention Variance**

* **Survivors of the Omnivault Event** remember fragments:

  * The fear

  * The grief

  * The chaos of societal collapse

  * Loved ones lost—names fading, feelings intact

* **Proximity Effect:** The closer a survivor was to the **Omnivault rupture zone**, the more fragmented their memory tends to be. Dissonance grows with proximity due to Resonance shockwaves during the Reset.

### **🧬 Intelligence & Recall Correlation**

* Survivors with **higher cognitive retention**, intelligence, or mental discipline retain clearer impressions:

  * Faces, building layouts, the smell of war

  * Fractured dreams of cities that never existed—but did

  * Sensory echoes rather than complete narratives

### **💡 Foundational Memory Consensus**

* All survivors agree on one point:

  * *“There was a world. It broke. We woke up in another.”*

  * Specific timelines, political names, or histories are blurred

  * Global knowledge coherence was lost—but emotional memory remains

## **II. Preserved Artifacts & Fossil Tech**

### **🪦 Unearthed Relics**

* A small number of pre-Reset objects continue to surface:

  * Books, clothing, data shards, powered-down personal AIs

  * Buried in collapsed foundations, deep under uninhabited soil

  * Items untouched by Eden's reconstruction nanite systems

### **🧰 Collection & Containment**

* Artifacts are quietly recovered by **RAU and Intelligence Directorate agents**

* Some are relocated to controlled vaults in **Europa**, **Mars**, or the **Terra Archive Array** beneath the Andes

* Study is permitted only under psychological shielding—high glyph-similarity risk materials are quarantined

### **📚 Public Display**

* Sanitized pieces are occasionally used in museums or education:

  * “The Age of Collapse” exhibits

  * Select ancient Earth cultures: Egyptian, Mesoamerican, early 21st-century digital tools

  * Always presented in a distant, abstracted tone—*this was before, and we rose from it*

## **III. Government Curation Protocols**

### **🏛️ The Archives Council**

* An elite sub-branch of the Ministry of Civic Memory

* Charged with:

  * Filtering and approving all pre-Reset texts for public integration

  * Working with BALANCE and WHISPER to detect memory-based recursion or distress

  * Authorizing special viewing access for researchers, artists, or philosophers

### **🚫 The Vault Directive**

* Certain materials are never allowed into circulation:

  * Political doctrines linked to mass violence

  * Philosophical texts prone to cultic reinterpretation

  * AI design archives connected to Nyra, Spectra, or early Gorgon programs

* These are either destroyed or kept in black-level containment

  * Access limited to Jefferson, Hale, and the Wentworths

---

## **IV. Folk Memory, Myth & Fiction**

### **📖 Whispered Past**

* Many details of the old world live on through:

  * Storytelling

  * Theater and song

  * “Inspired” fictional works that border on memory confession

* Common symbols:

  * Glass cities

  * Stars behind smog

  * Machines that wept

  * A voice at the end of time

“There are no history books. But there are dreamers.” – Alaric Jin, poet of Eden’s Fringe

### **🔍 Surveillance of Historical Creativity**

* MNEMOS and RAU watch for **repeating fictional patterns** that suggest bleedthrough or buried resonance

* Artists who consistently produce “echoed truths” are quietly flagged, then studied or redirected into constructive roles (Foundry arts, education)

---

## **V. Timeline Contamination Mitigation**

* **Temporal Drift Protocol 77-B**: Survivors who begin recalling detailed political or technological histories are offered therapeutic regression to reprocess and reframe their memories into metaphors

* **Echo-Lineage Drift Risk**: Children of the Reset may unintentionally channel old-world architecture, weapons, or language in art or design. These are never punished—but studied under the Psychological Codex protocols

* **Public View:** Pre-Reset history is seen as an uncertain dream—not a lie, but something too chaotic to build a future upon

*“History broke its spine the day the world changed. What walks now is the idea of what once was.” – Lillian McDonald*
