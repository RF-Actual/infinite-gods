# **üõ∞Ô∏è Minerva Station Codex ‚Äì Strategic Continuity Bastion**

**Classification:** Tier Omega ‚Äì Eyes Only (Jefferson McDonald, Aaron Wentworth)  
 **Designation:** MINERVA-1 / Codename: *Scatterforge*

---

## **I. Purpose & Strategic Role**

Minerva Station was designed by Jefferson as a last-resort fallback node for the **continuation of civilization** and **emergency reconstitution of military infrastructure** should Eden or Titan be compromised in a high-casualty peer conflict or multiversal incursion.

It is the **only autonomous forge capable of restoring continuity without command authorization** from a Ruling Council or central AI system. It answers only to Jefferson and Wentworth.

---

## **II. Location & Cloaking Protocols**

* **Position:** Neptune Trojan Point (L5), inside a dark matter interference field seeded with synthetic gravity anchors.

* **Stealth:**

  * Quantum occlusion lattice (non-reflective across all spectra)

  * Passive drift orbit matched to spatial debris signatures

  * Anti-signal diffusion skin prevents QEB handshake detection

Known only to Jefferson‚Äôs locked AI subroutine, Aaron Wentworth, and fail-safe package encoded in Hale‚Äôs command neural vault.

## **III. Physical Infrastructure**

* **Core Hull:** SANL Diamondoid Armor, reinforced with precursor alloy shielding

* **Size:** \~4.8 km long, modular cruciform layout with three bays:

  1. **Nanite Forge Hall** ‚Äì Capable of producing Gen 2 and early Gen 3 DANs

  2. **Military Assembly Core** ‚Äì Can fabricate standardized frigates, destroyers, and cruiser hulls using cached designs from the Titan Ring

  3. **Biogenesis Vault** ‚Äì Cryogenic embryo library, memory imprint archives, AI clone stacks (SEDA, NAVIA, WHISPER)

* **Power Core:** Helium-3 fusion matrix with Q-field surge capacity

---

## **IV. Operational Capabilities**

### **A. Production:**

* **Max Output:** \~30‚Äì40% of Titan Forge‚Äôs full capacity

* **Startup Time (Cold):** 72‚Äì96 hours

* **Staffing:**

  * Default: Fully automated with onboard SEDA shard coordination

  * Optional: Up to 220 crew revived from cryostasis

### **B. Defense:**

* Hidden defensive lattice with:

  * 6 autonomous Breach Lance turrets

  * Micro-railgun banks for close-range defense

  * AI-managed kinetic cloud screen for debris camouflage and hostile FCD entry suppression

### **C. AI & Data Redundancy:**

* Contains:

  * Full Jefferson Core Archive (airgapped)

  * Redundant backups of all military AI cores

  * Neuromorphic clone of MNEMOS with civil restoration and education templates

## **V. Activation Conditions**

| Condition | Trigger Event Detected By |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Omega Continuity Protocol** | Destruction of Eden AND Titan |
| **Cascade Decay Protocol** | Breach destabilization of resonance grid |
| **Manual Wake Protocol** | Neural override from Jefferson or Wentworth |
| **Dead Signal Wake** | 96+ hours of total QEB silence |

Once triggered, Minerva deploys recon drones, re-establishes communication with Mars or outer colonies, and begins **full strategic replication** of defense, education, and civil governance infrastructure.

‚ÄúThis station does not exist to survive the end. It exists to begin again.‚Äù ‚Äì Jefferson McDonald
