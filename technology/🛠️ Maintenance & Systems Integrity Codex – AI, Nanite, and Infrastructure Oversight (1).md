# **üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance & Systems Integrity Codex ‚Äì AI, Nanite, and Infrastructure Oversight**

**Classification:** Tier Black / Defense Council Eyes Only  
 **Oversight:** SEDA-TRIDENT, SHIELD-0, Department of Strategic Continuity, AI Systems Bureau

---

## **I. Purpose**

To codify the scheduled maintenance, performance integrity checks, and redundancy safeguards across Eden‚Äôs critical technological systems‚Äîspecifically its artificial intelligence networks, nanite ecosystems, and fleet-level infrastructure.

This codex exists to prevent systemic drift, detect unauthorized AI recursion, and maintain military/civil operational continuity across all theaters.

## **II. AI Systems Integrity Schedule**

| AI System | Schedule | Oversight | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **SEDA** (Construction/Engineering) | Weekly diagnostics \+ Monthly sync | Civil Infrastructure Bureau | Auto-syncs with Forge templates |
| **WHISPER** (SIGINT/Sensor Grid) | Real-time checks \+ Hard reboot every 10 days | Intelligence Directorate \+ SHIELD-0 | Phys. inspection every 90 days |
| **TACTICUS** (Tactical AI) | After-action scrub \+ full reset every 60 days | EDF Tactical Command | Integrated with DRNEX battle filters |
| **NAVIA / PATHFINDER** (Navigation/Astrogation) | Post-FCD jump recalibration \+ 30-cycle deep reset | Fleet AI Division | Critical for temporal drift corrections |
| **MNEMOS** (Memory/Foundry) | Weekly defrag \+ 45-day core cleanse | Education Council \+ Ethics Board | Monitors dream logic drift, psychological bleed |
| **SHIELD-0** (Continuity AI) | Monitored, not modified | Jefferson-exclusive node | Clone-verified every 7 days via mirror vault |

## **III. Fleet & Hardware Maintenance**

### **A. Fleet Vessels (Capital & Escort Class)**

* **Nanite Shell Diagnostics**: Passive scans weekly via DRNEX

* **Shield Calibration**: Daily during active patrol, recalibrated post-combat

* **FCD Core Realignment**: Every 10 jumps or 180 days

* **Weapon Systems**: Cold-fire simulations every 60 days; AI targeting recalibration every 30

### **B. Drone & Simulacrum Platforms**

* **DRNEX & SENTINEL**: Full data purge every 20 missions or 30 days

* **Simulacrum Templates**: Auto-reset post-op, never persist longer than 96 hrs without review

## **IV. Nanite System Maintenance**

| Nanite Type | Interval | Oversight | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Gen 2 DANs** (Construction/Medical) | Re-synced every 14 days | SEDA/Medical Corps | Random samples globally reviewed |
| **Gen 3 Bio-DANs** | Continuous neural feedback loop | Jefferson / Blacksite Biolabs | Any 0.01% instability triggers shutdown |
| **Forge Nanites** | Reforged every 45 days | Titan & Eden Forgefleet | Monitored for entropy or mutation risk |

---

## **V. Cognitive Defense & Dream Integrity**

* **MNEMOS \+ BALANCE Systems**:

  * Public Stability Matrix updates every 21 days

  * Dream-capture filtering reviewed for cross-timeline bleed

  * Civilian memory patches deployed silently if instability is detected

---

## **VI. Redundancy & Contingency Measures**

* All core AI cloned across **Eden**, **Titan Forge**, and **Minerva Station**

* Every 30 days, a mirror-state clone is tested against original for drift tolerance (\<0.001%)

* Failsafe Cascade:

  * Any deviation outside tolerance initiates **immediate AI quarantine**

  * SEDA/SHIELD-0 reboots system using hard-stored quantum keychains

  * No auto-elevation of backup AI unless triggered by Jefferson command layer

‚ÄúPower is not in creation. It is in control. In discipline. In knowing what you built‚Äîand when to rebuild it.‚Äù ‚Äì Jefferson McDonald
