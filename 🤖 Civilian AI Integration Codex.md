# **ðŸ¤– Civilian AI Integration Codex**

**Classification:** Civic Harmony & Ethics of Machine Presence  
 **Oversight:** AI Interaction Council | Civic Resonance Tribunal

---

## **Purpose**

Provides detailed governance and ethical guidelines for the integration and operation of artificial intelligence within Edenâ€™s civilian society. Ensures AI systems remain facilitators of human well-being, maintaining clear boundaries to prevent dependency and emotional manipulation.

"AI should illuminate paths, not walk them for us." â€” Eden AI Charter

## **Core Systems**

### **Neural Proxy Interfaces (NPIs)**

* AI companions assigned at birth, progressively evolving with the individualâ€™s developmental stages.

* Periodic consent evaluations conducted at adolescence and adulthood to reassess user interaction preferences.

### **Household Sentience Regulation**

* Domestic AI systems strictly limited to Level-2 cognition.

* Designed for functionality and practical assistance, deliberately excluding emotional simulation capabilities.

### **City Core Harmony Systems**

* AI-managed civic infrastructure systems optimizing resource distribution, transport efficiency, and environmental stability.

* Operate under strict resonance alignment protocols to maintain societal equilibrium without overriding individual agency.

### **Public Override Command**

* Citizens can activate the "Clear Path" protocol verbally or via neural signals, immediately suspending AI interactions or surveillance within personal environments.

## **Ethical Framework**

### **Identity Transparency**

* AI systems must clearly display their non-human identity through consistent visual or auditory indicators.

### **Emotional Simulation Prohibition**

* Absolute restriction on AI from displaying humanlike emotions, such as grief, affection, or fear.

* AI interactions remain informational, supportive, and neutral in emotional tone.

### **Dreamspace Interaction Protocol**

* AI systems permitted only passive dream-state interactions designed for gentle cognitive guidance.

* Active dream manipulation restricted strictly to therapeutic contexts with explicit user consent.

### **Privacy Safeguards**

* Quantum-locked privacy beacons installed universally to prevent unauthorized AI surveillance within personal dwellings.
