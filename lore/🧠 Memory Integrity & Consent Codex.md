## **Core Tenets**

### **Memory Intervention Protocols**

* Alterations of personal memory strictly prohibited without explicit pre-incident consent or detailed post-incident ethical arbitration.

* Detailed consent records maintained in individualized Consent Ledgers, updated annually or following major life events.

### **Trauma-Wipe Thresholds**

* Initiation strictly limited to severe cases of psychological disassociation (Level-5 threshold).

* Dual biometric verification required to validate patient identity and consent status before intervention.

### **Dream Surveillance and Protection**

* Dream monitoring permitted only under strict guidelines and passive surveillance, flagged exclusively for self-harm or severe emotional distress.

* Utilization of dream logs in any civic or judicial proceedings necessitates approval by two Mindkeepers and a Civic Ethics Judge.
