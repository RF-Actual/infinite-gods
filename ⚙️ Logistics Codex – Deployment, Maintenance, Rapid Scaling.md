# **⚙️ Logistics Codex – Deployment, Maintenance, Rapid Scaling**

This codex defines how the Eden Defense Force (EDF) supplies, constructs, maintains, and scales its fleet, including contingency protocols under the Wentworth-led Warden Protocols.

---

## **A. Fleet-Wide Supply Chain**

### **🏗️ Resource Origination**

* **Raw Materials**: Sourced via automated AI-mined asteroids, Martian regolith, Jovian and Saturnian moons

* **Fuel & Processing**: Titan Forge (Hephaestus Station) processes hydrocarbons and deuterium/He-3

* **Advanced Components**: FCD cores, AI processors, and QEB relays fabricated under high security on Earth, Mars, and orbital platforms

* **Personnel Supplies**: Nutrient paste shipped from Eden, closed-loop food and medical nanite systems onboard

### **🚚 Transport & Distribution**

* **FCD Cargo Haulers**: Slow, high-capacity supply fleet managed by logistics AI \+ NAVIA overlays

* **Escort Protocols**: High-value shipments escorted by Navy corvettes or included in encrypted convoy routes

* **Storage Nodes**: Distributed across:

  * Earth/Mars orbital depots

  * Titan Forge megayard

  * Deep-space anchorages

  * Interstellar caches (minimal)

---

## **B. Shipbuilding Rate & Maintenance**

### **🛠️ Construction**

* **Primary Sites**: Titan Forge, Mars Orbital Ring, Luna Shipyards

* **Method**: SEDA AI \+ DANs grow SANL spaceframes

* **Bottlenecks**: FCD cores, high-tier processors, AI nodes

* **Peacetime Rate**: 1–2 capital ships/year, numerous escorts

### **🔧 Maintenance**

* **Routine**: WHISPER/SEDA-run diagnostics and onboard DAN repairs

* **Scheduled Overhauls**: Conducted at major yards; includes full system refreshes

* **Combat Repairs**: SEDA-controlled emergency sealing, structural patching, rerouting power

---

## **C. Storage Infrastructure**

### **📦 Weapons**

* Stored in shielded orbital depots or hardened ground bunkers

* Multi-layered clearance (QEB, biometric, Council sign-off for strategic ordnance)

### **⚙️ Spare Parts**

* Stockpiled QMP drives, plasma conduits, AI modules, and modular hull panels

* Pre-fabricated spaceframe modules for rapid expansion

### **🚨 Escape Vessels**

* Full networked escape pods

* Carriers equipped with Harbinger-class shuttles for mass evac

---

## **D. Wentworth Contingency Systems – *Warden Protocols***

Classified EDF systems activated only in the event of existential crisis.

### **🧨 Rapid Fleet Scaling – *Project Aegis***

* **Nanite Forge Activation**: Dormant forge nodes across Trojan asteroids and deep-space facilities can be remotely awakened

* **Resource Surge Protocols**: Reroutes civilian/research pipelines into military production

* **Accelerated SEDA Mode**: Pushes ship growth to unsafe but functional thresholds. Reduced lifespan tolerated

### **🧬 Personnel Augmentation – *Project Chimera***

#### **Neural Pattern Induction**

* Direct neuro-imprinting of tactical/technical data into fresh recruits

* Drastically reduces training windows

* High cognitive strain risk

#### **Deep Black Bio-Augmentation (Limited)**

* Use of Gen 3 Bio-DANs to create or enhance specialist operators

* Rapid-matured clones for breach hazard teams or FCD-core repair

* High ethical oversight. Extreme clearance only

#### **Simulacrum Forces**

* Used for deception or disinformation (false fleet signals, decoy units)

* Not for battlefield replacement of personnel

### **🛡️ Strategic Focus**

Wentworth doctrine emphasizes **overwhelming industrial output**:

* Win through volume and rapid escalation

* Personnel solutions are emergency-use only
