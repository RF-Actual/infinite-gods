## **A. Rank Breakdown & Ship Command**

The EDF Space Navy adapts traditional naval hierarchy with augmented roles for advanced AI integration.

### **🛡️ Command Assignments by Class:**

| Ship Class | CO Rank | XO Rank |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Frigate/Destroyer | Commander (O-5) | Lieutenant Commander (O-4) |
| Cruiser | Captain (O-6) | Commander (O-5) |
| Carrier/Dreadnought | Captain (O-6) or Commodore/Rear Admiral (O-7) | Commander or Senior Captain |
| Orbital Platform | Variable: Senior Captain or Admiral |  |

### **🔧 Key Bridge Roles:**

* **CO (Commanding Officer)** – Strategic command, ultimate authority

* **XO (Executive Officer)** – Crew operations, readiness, administrative oversight

* **Tactical Officer (TacO)** – Weapons systems, targeting, TACTICUS/SENTINEL integration

* **Operations Officer (Ops)** – Power systems, repair coordination, SEDA liaison

* **Navigation Officer (Nav/Helm)** – QMP/FCD maneuvers, NAVIA/PATHFINDER interfacing

* **Communications Officer (Comms)** – QEB management, WHISPER integration

* **Chief Engineer** – Drives, reactors, DAN systems, life support

* **Chief Medical Officer (CMO)** – Crew health, diagnostics, nanite bio-integrity

* **Marine Detachment Commander** – Internal security, Marine deployment coordination

### **🤖 AI Integration:**

* All stations rely on non-sentient AI to streamline operations, enabling crew to focus on decision-making and human-centric judgment

* Final strategic, weapons, and FCD activations always require human authorization

## **B. Daily Routines Aboard Capital Ships**

### **🕒 Shift Cycles:**

* **Standard:** 3-shift rotation (8 on / 16 off)

* **Extended Vessels:** 4-shift cycle for fatigue reduction on long deployments

### **🔄 Daily Duties:**

* System diagnostics

* Physical training & simulations

* Combat, damage control, or boarding drills

* Nanite-assisted maintenance protocols

* Neural induction refreshers for skill sustainment

### **🍽️ Meals:**

* Nutrient dispenser systems \+ communal mess halls

* Hydroponics and vat-protein options enhance morale on larger ships

### **🧘 Personal Time:**

* Simulation/VR pods

* Rec lounges, zero-G areas

* Delayed QEB packet comms to Eden

---

## **C. Morale & Mental Health Protocols**

### **🌱 Facilities:**

* Gymnasiums, zero-G rec, lounges

* Simulation suites and hydro-gardens (larger ships only)

### **🧠 Psychological Support:**

* Human counselors and therapy-trained AI

* Integrated check-ins tied to medical scans

* QEB-based confidential therapy portals

* Emphasis on unit cohesion and “purpose-driven” command culture

### **🛏️ Coping with Utopia Contrast:**

* Reinforced mission identity

* Recognition programs, story archives of RENIK

* Officer mentorship and family holofeeds help maintain psychological continuity

---

## **D. Combat Rotation Protocols**

### **⏳ Tour Lengths:**

* **High-intensity Fleets:** 6–12 months max before rotation

* **Colony Defense/Observation Fleets:** Longer, lower stress

### **🔁 Rotation Cycle:**

1. Forward Deployment

2. Reserve Patrol / Colony Defense

3. Shipyard Refit (Shore Leave)

4. Training Commands / Garrison Duty

### **🩺 Post-Combat Stand-Down:**

* Debriefing & psychological assessment

* Optional reassignment or long-term recovery

* Fleet Command and Medical jointly oversee full reintegration
