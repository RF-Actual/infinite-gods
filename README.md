# **üåå Infinite Gods Codex**

*"What we preserve is not merely memory ‚Äî it is the foundation of all futures yet unwritten."*

---

## **üìö Project Purpose**

The **Infinite Gods Codex** is a modular, evolving archive designed to chronicle the technological, military, cultural, and mythological framework of the post-reset Eden civilization.  
 It serves as the canonical worldbuilding foundation for all Infinite Gods novels, spin-offs, expansions, and tactical deployments.

Each folder contains tightly focused `.md` files that maintain clear narrative and structural continuity across all story arcs and timeline branches.

| `/lore/` | Historical timelines, mythmaking, resonance religion, media and memory integrity protocols. |
| `/military/` | Tactical doctrine, war plans, ground forces, navy structure, Foundry combat integration. |
| `/naval/` | Naval-specific fleet construction, command doctrine, shipboard life, and crew structure codices. |
| `/resonance/` | Placeholder for future Resonance phenomenon expansions (glyph theory, quantum bleed, Echo-born analysis). |

## **üõ°Ô∏è Codex Management Philosophy**

* **Modular Expansion**: Every new book, arc, or faction expansion must plug cleanly into an existing category or create a new, minimal branch.

* **Canonical Integrity**: Once published, codex entries are considered **hard canon** unless retconned through timeline fractures or Resonance events.

* **Professional Scalability**: Folder and file naming conventions should remain clean, lowercase if possible, and descriptive without excessive abbreviations.

* **Chronological Archiving**: Major retcons, world shifts (e.g., Post-Reset ‚Üí Forbidden Timeline breach) should be versioned cleanly with timestamps or event tags.

* **AI & Human Symbiosis**: Infinite Gods Codex accepts updates, cross-references, and expansions generated both manually (author-controlled) and dynamically (AI-augmented).
