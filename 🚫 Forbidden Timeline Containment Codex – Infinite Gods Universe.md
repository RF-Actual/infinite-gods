# **🚫 Forbidden Timeline Containment Codex – Infinite Gods Universe**

This codex outlines containment, response, and suppression protocols related to the Forbidden Timeline (FTL)—a corrupted, alternate multiversal branch characterized by death-based infrastructure, hostile variants, and high resonance instability. First breached unintentionally by Maya and Orin, this timeline poses the greatest known existential threat to Eden.

---

## **I. Definition & Scope**

### **🌌 Designation: Forbidden Timeline (FTL-1/Black Spire)**

* A reality discovered via **unintentional timeline traversal** by Maya Hale and Orin McDonald

* Dominated by recursive war logic, decayed civilizations, and corrupted reflections of Eden’s founders

* Timeline is **resonance hostile**—direct contact destabilizes local spacetime in Eden-adjacent zones

* Architecture resembles **semi-organic fortress worlds**, believed to be shaped by anti-Hale and anti-Jefferson entities

---

## **II. Detection & Monitoring**

### **🛰️ VANTAGE Platforms**

* Maintain continuous gravitational, exotic particle, and temporal field scans near known FTL breach scars

* Equipped with **QEB-isolated logic cores** to prevent corruption or timeline echo propagation

### **📊 RAU \+ PATHFINDER Oversight**

* RAU flags anomalous spacetime distortions consistent with FTL event signatures

* PATHFINDER runs continuous **“Black Thread” subroutines**—multiversal probability trees scanning for emerging incursion vectors

* Glyphline children’s dreams are monitored for predictive bleed

---

## **III. Contact Protocols**

### **❌ Absolute Prohibition**

* No intentional traversal or communication with the Forbidden Timeline is permitted under any circumstance

* Any mission to interact with FTL anomalies requires **unanimous Ruling Council approval** and is considered a last-resort action

### **🛑 Incursion Response SOP**

* Upon confirmed breach or incursion:

  * **Lockdown of affected region** (spatial or planetary)

  * Activation of **Omega-Class Breach Response Fleet** with predefined containment loadout

  * **FTL-specific ROE enacted**, including pre-authorized use of Graviton Pulse Torpedoes, nanite cascade failsafes, and timeline-burn ordnance (under review)

* All non-essential personnel within breach radius evacuated

* TACTICUS & SENTINEL assume joint operational control with human override

---

## **IV. Echo-Bloodline Provisions**

### **🧬 Cognitive Containment Protocol 17A**

* Any Echo/Resonance bloodline member exhibiting:

  * Unexplained memory sequences

  * Repetitive symbol drawing (glyphs not native to Eden)

  * Dissociative temporal looping

* Must be isolated within a **Resonance Shielded Environment**

* Subject to deep neural-memetic mapping and live monitoring by Jefferson, Hale, and the Ethics Oversight Division

* No memory suppression allowed unless cascade risk is deemed irreversible

---

## **V. Breach Containment Infrastructure**

### **🛡️ Quarantine Protocol Alpha-Ring**

* Established around previously breached areas using:

  * Microresonance lattice barriers

  * Stationed FORT teams with breach-specific countermeasures

  * Path-Null drones to collapse unstable fissures

### **🧨 Weaponization Protocol (Conditional Use)**

* High-yield temporal disruption weapons must be approved via **Black Dagger Consensus**:

  * Hale, Jefferson, Defense Secretary, and RAU/TACTICUS all vote

  * Only used if breach cannot be collapsed through traditional means

---

## **VI. Secrecy & Civilian Containment**

### **🕶️ Protocol 9-Veil**

* All civilian exposure to Forbidden Timeline concepts is classified **Omega-Red**

  * Memories suppressed if minor, relocation/containment if persistent

  * Whisper cults or fringe groups attempting glyph-channeling are neutralized or disbanded covertly

### **🧠 Psychological Reinforcement**

* Citizens or children found displaying ideation connected to FTL are monitored via **MNEMOS**

* Creative works reviewed for recursion motifs or resonant anomalies

* Emotional Ethics Council may initiate surveillance or corrective mentorship
