## **A. Civilian Wear (Eden Standard)**

### **Core Materials**

* **Climate-Adaptive Nanofiber Fabrics**

  * *Environmental Adaptation:* Adjust insulation, moisture-wicking, and breathability in real time based on biometrics and ambient conditions

  * *Self-Cleaning/Repairing:* Nanites break down dirt, repair fabric using ambient moisture and trace carbon

  * *Customization:* Texture, color, and pattern changeable via neural interface or handheld controller

  * *Durability:* High tensile strength, abrasion resistance

### **Styles & Function**

* Wide aesthetic range from minimalist to ornate

* Post-scarcity fashion reflects artistic, scientific, cultural values

### **Specialized Civilian Gear**

* **Environmental Suits** for colonists and hazardous zones

  * Enhanced shielding, life support, mobility integration

  * Based on adaptive nanofiber foundation

  * No Resonance-specific insulation or systems

## **B. Military Gear (Eden Defense Force \- EDF)**

### **Armor Systems**

* **Material:** SANL-Derived Composite Armor

  * Carbon-diamondoid polymaterials

  * Kinetic dampening, thermal insulation, limited radiation shielding

  * Self-repair functions via embedded DANs (requires replenishment)

* **Variants:**

  * *Marine Combat Armor:* Full-body plating, enhanced survivability

  * *Navy Shipboard Suits:* Lighter, designed for vacuum/fire protection

  * *SOCOM Units:* Lighter, high mobility, enhanced sensor payloads

### **Exosuits / Combat Frames**

* **Designation:** Neural-Linked Combat Frame (NCF)

* *Functionality:*

  * Strength amplification, suit power distribution

  * Heavy weapon stabilization

  * Neural-haptic integration with HUD and AI (WHISPER, TACTICUS)

  * No Glyph or Resonance integration

### **Camouflage & Signature Management**

* **Multi-Spectrum Adaptive Camouflage**

  * Visual/thermal/limited EM adaptation

  * Environment-responsive

  * Managed by WHISPER-class tactical AI

### **Helmets & HUD**

* Full protective sealing

* Integrated comms, QEB relay-compatible

* Thermal, EM, low-light sensors

* AI-curated tactical overlays: threats, nav, biometrics, squad status

## **C. Weaponry (EDF Standard Issue & Specialized)**

### **Personal Sidearms**

* **P-7 Plasma Pistol**

  * Compact, semi-auto, directed energy

* **KSP-3 Kinetic Shard Projector**

  * Fires high-velocity flechettes

  * Effective against light armor

### **Primary Rifles**

* **MCR-5 Modular Combat Rifle**

  * Dual-mode: plasma bolts or kinetic slugs (EM rail)

  * Modular frame for optics, grenade launchers, plasma torch

  * Integrated HUD/AI targeting interface

### **Support & Heavy Weapons**

* **PL-2 Squad Plasma Launcher**

  * AOE plasma ordinance

* **AMR-1 Anti-Materiel Railgun**

  * Heavy kinetic firepower

  * Requires NCF stabilization

* **SDW-4 Sonic/Concussive Projector**

  * Less-lethal crowd suppression

### **Specialized & Ship-Based Systems**

* **Breach Lances**

  * Vehicle/ship-mounted

  * Shield/armor penetration through energy convergence

  * FCD-derived physics

* *Resonance Disruptors:* Mythic tech, not in general EDF use
