# **üëΩ Alien Contact Protocol Codex ‚Äì First Encounter Contingency Framework**

**Classification:** Omega Red ‚Äì Ruling Council Only  
 **Oversight:** Jefferson McDonald (Strategic Ethics), PATHFINDER Subnetwork, Intelligence Directorate SIGINT/EXOBIO Division

---

## **I. Doctrine Purpose**

To establish procedures and principles for responding to **first confirmed contact** with an **extraterrestrial intelligence**, whether biological, synthetic, or transdimensional.

---

## **II. Trigger Criteria**

Alien Contact Protocol is only activated if all of the following are confirmed:

1. **Origin** of contact is verifiably **non-human and non-terrestrial**

2. Signal or encounter shows **intentional structure** (language, mathematics, directed behavior)

3. Contact cannot be traced to a timeline echo, simulation bleed, or breach projection (i.e., not resonance artifact)

‚ÄúWhat is alien is not what we expect‚Äîit is what cannot be mistaken for us.‚Äù ‚Äì Jefferson McDonald

## **III. Levels of Contact**

| Tier | Description | Primary Response Lead |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| I | Passive Signal Detection | PATHFINDER AI \+ WHISPER |
| II | Directed Signal or Contact Attempt | Intelligence Directorate |
| III | Physical Encounter (unmanned) | RAU \+ STAG, quarantine initiated |
| IV | Physical Encounter (biological/synthetic) | EDF High Command \+ Quarantine Corps |
| V | Persistent Contact / Societal Awareness | Ruling Council Directive Only |

## **IV. Core Protocols**

### **A. Secrecy and Containment**

* All detection of Tier I‚ÄìIV contact events is automatically **quarantined by SHIELD-0**

* QEB communications involving alien contact auto-route to Jefferson, Hale, and the Council only

* Civilian disclosure is suspended unless the Council approves phased integration strategy

### **B. Encounter Ethics**

* **Do not assume hostility or intent**

* No attempts at reverse engineering or data capture unless alien intelligence is proven non-sentient or inert

* Lethal force authorized **only in defense of life or timeline stability**

### **C. Technological Safeguards**

* All alien technology is classified as **Breach-Level Hazard** until cleared by RAU and SPARK teams

* Direct interface prohibited without STAG containment protocols and MNEMOS psychological safeguards in place

---

## **V. Diplomatic Infrastructure**

* **Lingua Vector Protocol:** PATHFINDER maintains dormant linguistic subroutines based on universal constants (Fibonacci, hydrogen signatures, prime signal fractals)

* **Contact Node Candidates:** Europa Spire and Ganymede Listening Post are designated Tier-1 Contact Sites (isolated, controllable, shielded)

* **First Contact Delegates:** To be selected from Jefferson-led panel including:

  * Strategic Ethics Council

  * Exobio Liaison Team (scientific first response)

  * Defense Readiness Representative (non-provocative)

---

## **VI. Risk Assessments**

* Possibility of **memetic infection** or echo contamination from alien languages

* Potential for **timeline bleed** if contact vector intersects resonance zone

* Alien biologicals may trigger nanite misfire or false identity prioritization

* If contact is traced to **higher-order reality manipulation**, containment becomes priority one

---

## **VII. Contact Probability Forecast (Strategic Estimate)**

### **üåå Eden-Aware Sentience Probability Matrix**

#### **Modified Contact Variables:**

| Factor | Description | Estimate |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **R**\* | Star formation rate in local galactic neighborhood | \~1.5‚Äì3 stars/year |
| **f‚Çö** | Fraction of stars with planets | \~0.8 |
| **n‚Çë** | Habitable planets per system | \~0.3 |
| **f‚Çó** | Planets where life arises | \~0.5 |
| **f·µ¢** | Planets where intelligence evolves | \~0.1 |
| **f·∂ú** | Civilizations developing detectable technology | \~0.05 |
| **L** | Avg. duration of detectable civilizations | \~10,000‚Äì100,000 years |

Analysis based on Eden's current detection radius (\~300 light-years), PATHFINDER anomaly filtration, and known FCD traversal routes.

#### **üß† Strategic Forecast (As of Book 2):**

| Contact Type | Probability (Next 50 Years) | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Passive Signal Detection** | \~45% | Likely via PATHFINDER or Ganymede station array |
| **Artifact or Probe Discovery** | \~15% | More likely in breach-disrupted systems or ancient war zones |
| **Biological Encounter** | \~8% | Possibility highest via Breach misclassification or deep outpost interaction |
| **Direct Contact** | \<1% | Presumed only if initiated by advanced civilization avoiding concealment |

‚ÄúThe greatest odds of contact may not lie in our signal reaching them‚Äîbut in what their silence means.‚Äù ‚Äì SHIELD-0

## **VIII. Protocol Override**

* In the event of societal destabilization due to contact:

  * MNEMOS initiates **Memory Layer Quarantine**

  * BALANCE reprograms narrative stability through Foundry/education overlays

  * SHIELD-0 isolates contact intelligence in recursive vaults until containment is confirmed

‚ÄúWe once imagined first contact as awe. We now prepare for it as containment.‚Äù ‚Äì Aaron Wentworth
