## 🧬 Biological & Genetic Similarity

| Species | DNA Compatibility | Primary Biological Divergence | Physiological Anomaly |
|--------|--------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| Humans | 100% | N/A | High emotional variability |
| Nyari | 87.2% | Light-based neural lattice | Bioluminescence, no vocal cords, direct resonance perception |
| Dra’uun | ~81% | High-gravity musculature | Total memory fidelity, scar-encoded cultural memory |
| Eidolon | Unknown | Non-physical or pan-dimensional presence | Possible glyphic resonance anchor points in pre-temporal zones |

## 🧠 Cognitive & Cultural Matrix

| Species | Memory | Communication | Social Structure | Emotional Cognition |
|--------|--------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Humans | Episodic / imperfect | Symbolic / verbal | Individualist-variant | High empathy, impulsive |
| Nyari | Distributed harmonic memory | Bioluminescent lattice (non-verbal) | Resonant collectives | Low emotional variance, high pattern-dependence |
| Dra’uun | Perfect recall | Direct memory linkage | Memory-arch hierarchical | Emotion filtered through history |
| Eidolon | Nonlinear recursion | None detected | Unknown | Indeterminate; reaction may precede action |

## 🚀 Technological Comparison

| Species | Propulsion | Weapon Systems | Information Storage | Strategic Weakness |
|--------|------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Humans | Fusion Core Drives / FCD | Conventional + Echo-based | Synthetic neural net / Quantum AI | Internal division, emotional interference |
| Nyari | Harmonic folding | Resonance disarmament / bio-agents | Biostructural harmonic encoding | Fragile to physical impact, non-aggressive |
| Dra’uun | Gravity-beacon gates | Graviton projectors / memory dampening | Crystalline redundancy with neural link | Predictability if encountering novel recursion |
| Eidolon | Unknown / Phase-shift | Unknown | Possibly timeline-internal | Observation-resistant, undefined form |

## 🛡️ Threat & Contact Summary

| Species | SHIELD-0 Rating | Pathfinder Clearance | Threat Focus | First Contact Protocol |
|--------|------------------|-----------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| Nyari | Amber | Echo-class + RAU | Resonance drift | Use synchronized non-verbal lattice signals |
| Dra’uun | Red | SHIELD-0 + RAU only | Recursive warfare | Avoid historical behavior pattern repetition |
| Eidolon | Black | OMEGA / Vault Command | Pan-temporal incursion | Full quarantine, blind scan, JEFFERSON override only |
