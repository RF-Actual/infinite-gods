# 🧠 Alien Codex: The Dra'uun (The Ever-Remembering)

**Homeworld:** Vaskel (217 Light Years)  
**DNA Compatibility with Humans:** ~81%  
**Environment:** Super-Earth, high gravity, methane ocean systems  
**Appearance:** Broad-shouldered bipeds with black sclera, phosphorescent irises, and scarification patterns representing lived memory

## 🕯️ Core Philosophy: Memory as Continuity
The Dra’uun do not forget. Every citizen remembers every moment of their life with perfect clarity. Memory is sacred. Forgetting is a holy mercy, granted only at death or through religious ritual.

Their society is built not on change, but preservation. All decisions, all technologies, are filtered through the lens of historical recursion. They view humans as dangerous because we forget—and thus repeat.

## 🧬 Biology
- Dense bone and muscle mass for high-G adaptation
- Memory retention architecture embedded into neural tissue
- Do not dream; incapable of metaphor or allegory
- Highly analytical; often fail to understand art or non-literal communication

## 🚀 Fleet Structure: The Archivist Armada

### 📷 Nugget / Witness (Surveyor Drone)
- Compact, shielded, autonomous drone with perfect recall sensors
- Weapons: Minimal point-defense only
- Function: Observation, data return, memory archival

### 🛡️ Bulwark / Archivist (Cruiser)
- Heavy memory-core bastion ship, reinforced with gravity-dampening architecture
- Weapons:
  - Gravity Projectors: crush, redirect, or pin ships
  - Kinetic Impactors: ultra-dense physical rounds
  - Cognitive Dampeners: local memory disruption fields
- Systems: Full neural linkage for onboard tactical analysis

### 🏛️ Keystone / Citadel (Dreadnought / Mobile Archive)
- Cultural ark vessels containing Dra’uun memory infrastructure
- Weapons:
  - Gravity Cannons (localized spacetime distortion)
  - Mass Drivers (city-sized kinetic slugs)
  - Planetary Shield Projectors
- Capabilities: Planetary defense, temporal disruption shielding, data banks encoding billions of lives

## 🛑 Known Protocols
- Will not engage unless memory of threat exceeds temporal threshold
- High tolerance for human error, low tolerance for pattern repetition
- React strongly to perceived recursion events (repeated human tactical behaviors)
