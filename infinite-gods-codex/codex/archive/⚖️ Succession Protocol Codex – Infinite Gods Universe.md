# **‚öñÔ∏è Succession Protocol Codex ‚Äì Infinite Gods Universe**

This codex outlines the political and command succession structure across Eden‚Äôs governing bodies, with special consideration for the unique role of Hale, Jefferson, and their lineage within the Ruling Council.

---

## **A. Legislative & Judicial Succession (House, Senate, Judiciary)**

* **Standard Procedure:** If a sitting Representative, Senator, or Supreme Court Justice retires, dies, or becomes incapacitated (as determined by formal review):

  * A **special election** must be held within 60 days to fill the legislative vacancy, adhering to veteran eligibility requirements. Voting utilizes the standard neural link system.

  * In the interim period before the election, a **provisional appointee** may be selected by district leadership, subject to formal approval by the Speaker of the relevant chamber (House or Senate) to ensure continuity.

  * Supreme Court Justice vacancies are filled only through formal nomination by a joint legislative committee and require confirmation **vote by the Ruling Council**.

---

## **B. Ruling Council Succession (Command Council)**

### **üë• Council Seat Replacement (Standard Members)**

* If a Ruling Council member holding a position tied to the legislature (Speakers) or judiciary (Justices) steps down or is lost:

  * The remaining Council members nominate and vote on a successor (typically drawn from senior leadership within the relevant branch).

  * A **two-thirds majority** (7 out of the standard 10 members, adjusted proportionally if foundational seats are vacant) is required to confirm the new member.

  * Public vetting is typically waived due to the Council's strategic nature; however, candidates must possess a proven record of national service (veteran status implied if replacing legislative speakers), demonstrated integrity, and verified psychological stability.

### **üß¨ Special Considerations ‚Äì Hale & Jefferson**

* **Jefferson McDonald:** His position is unique due to his post-human nature, foundational role, and integration with core systems. No replacement mechanism exists. Should he perish or be rendered non-functional, all systems under his direct neural trust default to pre-defined, sealed-state AI protocols managed by the highest security AI frameworks. His absence creates a permanent void on the Council; his former oversight responsibilities would be absorbed or reassigned across other sectors/members where possible.

  * Certain sealed subsystems tied to Jefferson‚Äôs architecture may only be accessed via glyph-sealed override mechanisms‚Äîaccessible only to Hale, or by unanimous agreement of **Maya, Orin, Silas, and Stellan** under direct Ruling Council supervision.

* **Travis Hale:** As the living Echo and primary architect of the Reset, his seat is also unique. While technically irreplaceable in function, Hale may nominate a potential successor *to his Council seat's influence and vote*, subject to mandatory Ruling Council approval.

  * His initial consideration is **Maya Hale**, acknowledging her lineage and power. However, her volatile temperament, focus on personal glory, and wavering discipline are significant concerns that increase with her age.

  * **Silas and Stellan Hale** (Twins) are increasingly viewed, by Hale and others on the Council, as the de facto successors for leadership stability. They possess proven honor, are respected by peers/mentors (including RENIK veterans), excel in their Foundry training (military/philosophical/psychological), and crucially, command the loyalty of emerging EDF ranks and possess significant public goodwill. While lacking the raw multiversal power of Maya or Orin, their stability and perceived dedication to duty make them the favored choice for inheriting Hale's *mantle of leadership* within the established structure.

### **üîÆ Current Succession Forecast (Ruling Council Internal Assessment)**

* If Hale were permanently lost, the Council is expected (though not formally bound) to approve either **Silas or Stellan Hale** (or potentially both in a shared/rotating capacity) to assume his *Council vote and representative role*, based on their demonstrated readiness and stability.

* Maya Hale remains a contingency, but confirming her would likely require a difficult unanimous Council vote due to acknowledged instability risks.

* Orin McDonald is generally considered unsuited for a direct leadership role due to his introspective nature. However, he is under consideration for a **future role as a strategic advisor or Keeper of the Resonant Archives**, should one be formalized.

## **C. Succession of Military Authority**

### **ü™ñ Chain of Command**

* Upon loss of the **Defense Secretary (Aaron Wentworth)**:

  * Command authority temporarily shifts jointly to the highest-ranking operational commanders of the Space Navy (currently Admiral Allison Wentworth/Zeller) and Marine Corps (a designated flag officer). The Ruling Council convenes within 14 days to nominate and confirm a permanent replacement Defense Secretary.

* If **both Hale and Defense Secretary Wentworth** were simultaneously lost:

  * Emergency command authority (strategic oversight, not Echo abilities) automatically devolves according to pre-planned directives within a secure **AI-linked succession module** maintained by the EDF Strategic Command Network.

  * This module's succession list is reviewed quarterly and requires **Hale's personal authorization** to modify.

---

## **D. Ethical Provisions & Emergency Clauses**

### **üß† Memory Integrity & Stability Testing**

* Any candidate nominated for a Ruling Council seat, *including* biological heirs like the Hale children, must undergo rigorous screening:

  * Deep-state psychological evaluations.

  * Neural-memetic profile integrity tests (checking for mental stability, hidden compulsions, or external influence).

  * *For Lineage Candidates Only:* **Echo-Resonance Stability Assessment** ‚Äì A specialized (likely classified and potentially administered only by Jefferson or under his direct supervision) test analyzing their neurological and psychological reaction *to* observed resonance phenomena or controlled stimuli, assessing stability rather than measuring power.

### **üõ°Ô∏è Council Override Clause**

* The Ruling Council retains the absolute right to reject any successor candidate, regardless of nomination source or lineage, if they fail to meet the stringent ethical, psychological, or stability standards required for Council membership.

* If no suitable candidate can be confirmed, the Council may operate with a vacant seat or appoint a non-voting interim placeholder advisor.

### **üß© Council Integrity Maintenance**

* All seated Ruling Council members are subject to **periodic neuro-ethical integrity reviews**, conducted independently by the Ethics Subdivision of the Intelligence Directorate.

* Refusal or failure to participate in this process results in **temporary suspension of voting rights** until cleared by a unanimous internal quorum.

*"Legacy is not inherited. It is chosen. It is earned every hour a leader chooses duty over self.‚Äù ‚Äì Attributed to Travis Hale*
