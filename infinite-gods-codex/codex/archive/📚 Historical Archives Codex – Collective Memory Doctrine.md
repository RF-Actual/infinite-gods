# **üìö Historical Archives Codex ‚Äì Collective Memory Doctrine**

**Classification:** Public Access (Filtered) / High Clearance (Full)  
 **Authority:** Eden Department of Public Information and Access (civilian), Strategic Records Division (military), supervised by Jefferson McDonald and Lillian McDonald

---

## **I. Purpose**

To define the collective historical record of the world before the Reset, the curation and suppression protocols regarding traumatic or destabilizing content, and the truth management systems that protect Eden‚Äôs cultural continuity.

---

## **II. Nature of Survivor Memory**

### **A. Memory Variance Post-Reset**

* Individuals who survived the Omnivault Collapse display **inconsistent recall** of pre-Reset history.

* **Factors impacting memory clarity:**

  * **Proximity to Site Theta / Omnivault**

  * **Cognitive resilience, trauma exposure, or high-function intelligence profiles**

  * **Age and neuroplasticity during Reset wave**

### **B. Memory Categories:**

| Type | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Vivid Recallers** | Often RENIK or high-IQ individuals. Retain coherent knowledge of geopolitics, family, cities, warfare, AI. Subject to frequent lucid nightmares or flash events. |
| **Fragmented Recallers** | Possess flashes, glimpses, or unplaceable emotion connected to past trauma. Inconsistent detail, but often react viscerally to relics. |
| **Post-Reset Normals** | Majority population. Retain only sanitized or reconstructed memory, often aligned to Eden's curated narratives. |

## **III. Official History (Public Curriculum)**

### **A. Taught Facts:**

* Humanity once lived in a fractured, war-torn, diseased world.

* The Reset was a **miraculous convergence** of last-hope technologies, human cooperation, and sacrifice.

* Eden was formed as the final, rational expression of peace and survival. Cities were rebuilt, infrastructure reformed, and governance rebooted to avoid history‚Äôs mistakes.

* Pre-Reset history is acknowledged in abstract‚Äîno specific nations or ideologies are emphasized. Students learn broad causes of collapse: greed, ignorance, unchecked AI, and ecological neglect.

### **B. Restricted Knowledge:**

* The words "Nyra," "Spectra," "Prometheon," "Omnivault," or any Resonance-linked pre-reset AI/tech are **fully redacted**.

* Historical figures associated with failure, genocide, or authoritarian collapse are omitted.

* All glyph activity, anomaly incursions, and timeline collapse data are classified as **‚Äúmetaphorical religious history‚Äù** in public records.

---

## **IV. Artifact & Data Management**

### **A. Found Relics:**

* Items uncovered during construction, excavation, or seismic events (e.g., pre-Reset clothing, books, storage media) are tagged and evaluated by the **Cultural Containment Unit (CCU)**.

* If non-harmful: Catalogued and displayed in **Memory Museums** with context-neutral descriptions.

* If disruptive: Sealed, or quietly destroyed.

### **B. Restricted Archives:**

* Located beneath the Eden Prime Capitol and in Vault Theta (Mars)

* Fully accessible only to Jefferson, Lillian, the Ruling Council, and Directorate-level historians cleared by Jefferson

* Includes unredacted pre-Reset history, military briefings, Spectra/Nyra records, AR footage from Breach events, psychological impact profiles

---

## **V. Psychological Monitoring**

* Foundry evaluations include latent recall detection via art, writing, music, and dreams.

* Civilian AI assistants are coded to flag anomalies in speech patterns, symbolism, or obsessions that may indicate **pre-Reset bleed**.

* Individuals with recurring exposure patterns are quietly counseled, redirected into productive study, or monitored by STAG (if escalation occurs).

---

## **VI. Religious Interpretation & Cultural Management**

* ‚Äúthe Pre-Eden Era‚Äù is often reframed in public mythology as a *dark age* or *pre-civil dawn*‚Äîa cautionary tale, not a factual timeline.

* Emergent religious sects referencing old-world imagery are often tolerated unless their doctrines show signs of destabilizing reality (e.g., timeline prophecy, glyph worship, or reactivation rites).

* Known *Echo cults* or *Prime Paradox heresies* are referred to ID for soft disbandment or psychological redirection.

---

## **VII. Authority of Truth**

All official history is curated under the Department of Public Information and Access in cooperation with Jefferson‚Äôs philosophical ethics loop.

Edits to historical canon require:

* Unanimous Ruling Council vote **or**

* Override by Jefferson himself

‚ÄúWhat you remember isn't always the truth. But what you build from it can be.‚Äù ‚Äì Jefferson McDonald
