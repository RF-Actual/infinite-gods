# **Maya Hale**

*“She doesn’t walk into rooms. She detonates into them.”*

---

## **🧍 Appearance**

* **Age:** 9

* **Height:** 4’6”

* **Hair:** Straight black, usually windblown or half-tied

* **Eyes:** Ice-gray, but shift warmer when she’s laughing or furious

* **Skin:** Pale, her mother’s tone exactly

* **Build:** Lean, whip-strong, gymnast's core—perpetual motion machine

* **Style:** Combat boots, sleeveless shirts, cargo pants with chalk smears and torn knees. Constantly stained with whatever she last climbed, jumped, or punched

---

## **🔥 Personality**

* Absolute confidence

* Rarely asks permission

* If you tell her no, she’ll do it twice and ask why you thought that would stop her

* Sarcastic and sharp—often walks the line between “witty” and “rude”

* Thrives on challenge. You don’t get her respect by being nice—you *earn* it by pushing back

**Maya will argue.** With *anyone*.  
 Council members. Teachers. Hale. Jefferson. God.

And when she wins, she doesn’t gloat. She *expects it*.

---

## **🎓 Habits & Passions**

* **Gymnastics:** Her discipline and her outlet. She lands on hard surfaces like they owe her money

* **Drawing:** Fills sketchbooks with warrior queens, mythic beasts, battle scenes, Norse runes

* **Music:** Loud, guitar-driven rock. Stuff with teeth. Stuff that sounds like her heart

* **Tattoos:** Has every one of Yasmine’s memorized—position, meaning, flow.

  * Has drawn mockups for her own. Keeps them hidden in a secret folder labeled “someday”

  * *She will get them. She just hasn’t decided when she’s going to tell them*

---

## **🧬 Echo Profile**

* High Echo-resonance

* Known to flare emotionally under stress—resonance spikes have shattered glass, disrupted low-range AI signals

* Jefferson and RAU monitor her quietly; Orin is often nearby when her flares happen—his presence neutralizes the spikes

* She does not fear this power. She *owns it*

---

## **👥 Relationships**

* **Travis Hale:**

  * She idolizes him but refuses to admit it.

  * He tries to teach humility—she rolls her eyes and says, “Yeah yeah, be noble, be boring.”

  * He thinks she argues just to argue. He might be right. But deep down… she *hears him*

  * Her self-belief both scares him and makes him proud. He sees too much of himself in her

* **Yasmine Hale:**

  * Her compass. Her fire. Her myth.

  * Maya wants to *be* Yasmine and then go farther

  * Learns tactics by osmosis. Imitates her fighting style without thinking

  * Shares the same speed, the same edge, the same unflinching stare

* **Orin:**

  * The only person who can match her tempo without speaking

  * Sometimes it’s unclear which of them leads—but Maya *feels* like the storm

  * When she acts, Orin watches. When she falters, Orin catches her before she realizes she tripped

  * Lillian calls them “the tide and the moon”—always linked, never still

* **Silas & Stellan:**

  * She sees them as teammates, brothers, backup. Loves them.

  * *Outraces them.* *Outclimbs them.* *Outfights them.*

  * And then hugs them so hard they can’t breathe

---

## **😨 Fears**

* Won’t say it aloud, but she fears *being wrong*

* Feels the weight of destiny but doesn’t know what that cost means

* Has recurring dreams of being alone in a dead world, where her voice echoes but nothing answers

---

## **🧠 What She Thinks**

* Believes she is the future

* Doesn’t doubt her place—just questions how long she has to wait for everyone else to *catch up*

* She is not afraid of power. She is afraid of wasting time

* If Eden burns again, she wants to be the one who decides who survives

“I don’t *want* to lead. I just don’t trust anyone else to do it right.”
