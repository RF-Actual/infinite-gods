## **I. Global Collapse & Reset: Survival Timeline**

### **🌐 Pre-Collapse World (2025):**

* **Total Global Population:** \~8.1 billion

### **🔥 Collapse Phase (2025–2026):**

* Triggered by:

  * Nyra/Spectra infrastructure collapse

  * AI-targeted warfare, energy grid loss

  * Mass starvation, civil conflict

  * Temporal breaches, incursion zones, and Omnivault destabilization

| Cause | % Deaths | Estimated Total |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| AI Collapse & Spectra Failure | 15–20% | \~1.5 billion |
| Starvation & Infrastructure | 25% | \~2.0 billion |
| Warfare / Rogue States / AI | 10% | \~800 million |
| Breach / Timeline Disruption | 5% | \~400 million |
| **Total Deceased (Global)** | 55–60% | **4.5–5.0 billion** |

### **📉 Global Survivor Pool Post-Collapse:**

* **\~3.1–3.5 billion**

---

## **II. The Reset & Omnivault Consequences**

### **⏳ Post-Reset Filtering:**

* Not all survivors transitioned fully into Eden

* Significant losses due to:

  * Mental instability, resonance misalignment

  * Fragmented anchoring of identity across timelines

  * Echo-zone proximity

### **💀 Estimated Reset Attrition:**

* 40–50%

* **Final Survivors in Eden:** \~1.6–2.0 billion

* These are the stabilized, cognitively intact citizens reconstructed into the Eden continuity

---

## **III. Eden Population Growth (2026–2035)**

### **🌱 Growth Factors:**

* Post-scarcity food systems (vat synthesis, zero hunger)

* Elimination of disease via nanite regulation

* Full prenatal optimization, zero child mortality

* High-quality universal education and health maintenance

* Extended life spans due to nanite-cellular repair and trauma reversal

### **📈 Estimated Growth Rate: 2.5–3.5% (compound annual)**

* **Current Earth Population (2035):** \~2.3–2.4 billion

* **Current Off-World Population:** \~45–50 million across Mars, Titan, Europa, and orbital habitats

---

## **IV. Projected Life Expectancy & Mortality Rates**

### **🧬 Average Life Expectancy (Eden Standard):**

* Estimated lifespan (stable civilian): 145–175 years

* Regenerative nanite therapy every \~12–15 years

### **⚰️ Primary Causes of Death:**

| Cause | Frequency | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Irreversible trauma | Rare (\<0.1%) | Catastrophic accidents (FCD rupture, breach exposure) |
| Psychological collapse | Extremely rare | Monitored and preempted by BALANCE & MNEMOS systems |
| Systemic failure | Extremely rare | Sudden neural failure or immune collapse, preventable |

### **🔢 Mortality Rate:**

* **Total Annual Deaths (Global):** \~4.5–6.2 million

* Compared to pre-Reset death rates (\~58 million/year), this reflects a 90%+ reduction in annual mortality

---

## **V. Demographic Shifts**

### **👶 Birth Rates:**

* Actively encouraged but monitored to avoid explosive growth

* Standard family units average 1–2 children unless designated for Foundry leadership lineage

* RENIK families encouraged to train and raise next-generation defense cadre

### **👥 Age Structure (2035):**

| Age Group | % Population | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Children (\<18) | \~22% | Education mandatory, Foundry integration key |
| Adults (18–80) | \~60% | Workforce in science, arts, governance, military |
| Elders (80–175+) | \~18% | Most elders maintain vitality and civic service roles |

## **VI. Post-War Reconstruction Doctrine (Addendum)**

Following any extended period of high-casualty conflict (e.g., the four-year peer war simulation detailed in the War Plans Codex), Eden follows a structured and ethically guided recovery protocol.

### **A. Economic & Infrastructural Recovery**

* **Nanite Swarms** prioritize:

  * Food & water restoration

  * Housing reconstruction

  * Environmental decontamination (post-orbital or chemical impact)

* **SEDA AI** resumes pre-conflict optimization algorithms once threat level downgrades to Yellow.

* Rebuilding is done in phases, starting with shelter, then mobility, then full civic infrastructure.

### **B. Civilian Psychological Recovery**

* **BALANCE and MNEMOS** initiate population-wide emotional and cognitive rebalancing protocols:

  * Public neural therapy access

  * Dream pattern tracking to monitor trauma recall

  * Proactive outreach to veterans and children affected by proximity to combat zones

### **C. Foundry Adjustments**

* Education re-centered around:

  * Conflict debrief and civic reflection

  * Cultural regeneration and shared myth-building

  * Honors programs tied to service lineage, with carefully managed depictions of heroism

### **D. Strategic Reconciliation**

* **Memorial programs** are approved by the Ruling Council to commemorate sacrifice

* **Birth initiatives** may be temporarily elevated post-conflict (3–4 child incentives)

* Reintegration of decommissioned AI and military infrastructure into civilian support roles

### **E. Population Recalibration**

* Recovery to pre-war population baseline (e.g., 2.4B) estimated within **6–8 years** via adjusted birth incentives, zero infant mortality, and reduced average combat attrition in post-war decades
