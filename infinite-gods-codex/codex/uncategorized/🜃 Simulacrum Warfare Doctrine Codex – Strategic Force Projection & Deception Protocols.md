# **üúÉ Simulacrum Warfare Doctrine Codex ‚Äì Strategic Force Projection & Deception Protocols**

**Classification:** Tier Black / Defense Council Eyes Only  
 **Oversight:** General Aaron Wentworth (EDF), SHIELD-0, SEDA-TRIDENT, and Blacksite Simulation Units

---

## **I. Purpose**

To outline the authorized use, operational scope, and ethical boundaries of **simulacrum warfare**: the deployment of **non-sentient synthetic constructs**, AI-driven **false fleet projections**, and neural projection decoys in psychological and battlefield engagements.

These systems are used to:

* Preserve human life

* Overwhelm enemy sensor networks

* Maintain strategic ambiguity

* Execute risk-free tactical operations in hostile or anomalous zones

---

## **II. Types of Simulacra & Deployment Profiles**

### **A. Tactical Simulacra (Combat Constructs)**

* **Designation:** SHADOW-ECHO Units

* **Description:** Physically manifested, AI-guided human analogs used in direct action operations. Appear identical to Marines or Naval personnel. Non-sentient. Controlled by local TACTICUS or sub-AI.

* **Capabilities:**

  * Execute basic maneuver warfare, suppressive fire, breach protocols

  * Carry modified weapons that simulate standard EDF fire signatures

  * Immune to fear, fatigue, or psychological disruption

  * Used for deception, sacrificial decoy missions, or overwhelming enemy forces

### **B. Projected Fleet Entities**

* **Designation:** GHOST-WING Protocol

* **Description:** Q-lattice sensor manipulations and signal mimics projected across deep space or orbital fields to simulate entire battle groups.

* **Function:**

  * Delay or misdirect enemy fleets

  * Trigger premature enemy weapon deployment

  * Buy time for repositioning or withdrawal of real forces

### **C. Neural Ghost Nodes**

* **Designation:** MIRAGE-NODE Systems

* **Description:** Broadcast localized psychic echo imprints into enemy neural feedback loops (via exposed resonance bleed zones)

* **Function:**

  * Induce confusion or visual/audio hallucinations in hostile troops

  * Mimic sounds of EDF troop movement, command chatter, or false retreat

  * Used primarily in Breach-adjacent combat zones

---

## **III. Ethical Constraints**

* **Simulacra must not be mistaken for real personnel by Eden citizens or allies.**

  * All units marked by invisible spectral signature ID readable by friendly WHISPER AI.

* **No simulacra may be used in diplomatic contexts or to impersonate Ruling Council members or known figures**.

* Simulacra are never to be equipped with **self-awareness subroutines** or emotional mimicry.

* All GHOST-WING fleet projections must carry a **temporal decay signature** to avoid misidentification in post-battle analysis.

---

## **IV. Command Structure & Deployment Authority**

* **Authorization Required:**

  * SHADOW-ECHO field deployments: General Wentworth or delegated SOCOM Commanders

  * GHOST-WING projections: EDF High Command in coordination with NAVIA/PATHFINDER

  * MIRAGE-NODE systems: Requires STAG approval and containment officer present

* **SEDA-TRIDENT AI** handles simulacrum formation and behavior programming

* DRNEX AI provides targeting data and situational correction

---

## **V. Strategic Applications**

| Scenario | Deployment Type | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Orbital Reinforcement Delay | GHOST-WING | Misdirect enemy ship formations |
| Urban Disruption (Occupied Zone) | SHADOW-ECHO | Create illusion of reinforcements |
| Breach Zone Psychological Denial | MIRAGE-NODE | Fracture enemy squad cohesion |
| Terminal Defense (Fallback Point) | SHADOW-ECHO \+ Drones | Delay enemy, buy evacuation time |

---

## **VI. Failover & Decontamination**

* All simulacra must be **terminated upon mission conclusion** unless otherwise ordered

* SHIELD-0 sweeps post-engagement zones for unsanctioned AI behavior fragments or MIRAGE residue

* Any simulacrum left active beyond protocol window is treated as a **rogue element** and neutralized
