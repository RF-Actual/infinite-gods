# **Section III: EDF Naval Logistics Codex**

**Classification:** Fleet Sustainment & Resource Allocation Doctrine  
 **Oversight:** Department of Strategic Supply | Naval Systems Command

## **Core Fuel Types**

* **Hydrogen-Helium Fusion Cells (H2He-FCs):** Primary propulsion for all capital ships and orbital-to-deep space transfers.

* **Tritium-Boosted Microfusion (TBMF):** High-output reactors used in Dreadnoughts and Nexus-class Carriers.

* **Resonance-Catalyzed Plasma (RCP):** Experimental—used in anomaly-tuned vessels. Requires resonance crystal initiators.

## **Nanite Feedstock Supply**

* **Primary Components:** Carbon substrate, programmable metallic dust (PMD), bio-silicates.

* **Manufacturing Nodes:** Found in orbital shipyards, Minerva Station, and Eden's equatorial belt foundries.

* **Logistics:** Shipped via sealed AI-pallets, distributed by drone subgrids and sealed rail relays.

## **Fusion Maintenance Cycles**

* **Cycle Window:** Every 11.2 months (mid-weight ships), 7.8 months (carriers), 6.1 months (dreadnoughts)

* **Required Actions:** Chamber flushing, plasma containment recalibration, quantum flux capacitor desync scan, nanite scaffold renewal.

* **Risk Zones:** High for poorly aligned resonance ships—containment failure can induce micro-tears in hull-resonance shielding.

## **Ship Resupply Infrastructure**

* **Megastructure Resupply Pylons (MRPs):** Stationed at Lagrange Point outposts, Europa Ring, and Mars Drydock Array.

* **Autonomous Resupply Carriers (ARCs):** Long-haul haulers equipped with foldpoint optimization drones. Requisitioned via JEFFERSON's logistical layer.

* **Dropgate Tactical Pods:** Mid-combat refueling and ammunition pods, launched by support cruisers for high-intensity engagements.

## **Planetary Supply Grid**

* **Eden Surface Grid:** AI-controlled subterranean pipelines and maglev-core for raw material and nanite dispersal.

* **Martian & Lunar Forward Nodes:** Constructed from scrapfall reforge and in-situ regolith reactors. Supply deep orbital squadrons.

* **Titan Cryo-Lines:** Deliver frozen fuel blocks and water to the outer ring vessels. Low-temperature nanite resupply staging point.

## **Notes on Rarity & Risk**

* **Resonance Crystals:** Only sourced from Breach Ruptures. Logged by RAU and guarded under triple-signed clearance.

* **Synthetic Isotopes (Fission & Fusion-grade):** AI-synthesized only within Megaforge Black Zones. Tampering forbidden.

* **Nanite Integrity Threshold:** Cross-contamination with anomalous matter results in liquefaction or rampant replication.

"Every bullet, every breath of air, every ion trail… must be earned, purified, and sanctified by code. A perfect navy is not one that fires—it's one that never runs dry." — JEFFERSON Logistics Layer 07-Prime

# **Section IV: Veteran Integration & Civilian Support Codex**

**Classification:** Post-Combat Lifecycle Protocols & Civil Reintegration Doctrine  
 **Oversight:** Department of Reintegration Affairs | Foundry Ministry of Continuity

## **Reintegration Tiers**

* **Tier 1: Return to Service (Voluntary)**  
   *Role:* Veterans may return to Foundry instruction, orbital defense, AI ethics board, or tactical advisory posts. *Examples:* RENIK cadre leadership, child mentorship programs, planetary militia doctrine councils.

* **Tier 2: Civil Sanctuary Rotation**  
   *Role:* Relocation to resonance-buffered sanctuaries for psychological restoration and memory equilibrium. *Notes:* No automated AI permitted in core living spaces. Optional dream guidance via Mnemos-certified counselors.

* **Tier 3: Specialist Legacy Placement**  
   *Role:* Direct insertion into long-term mythic reconstruction, such as the Glyph Archive, Echo Chorus curation, or the Ascension Gardens project. *Notes:* Candidates must pass identity stability screening (ISC-9).

## **Recovery Architecture**

* **Foundry Echo Clinics:** AI-free trauma processing centers where survivors confront resonance bleed, combat recursion, and memory loop degradation.

* **Hall of the Buried Flame:** A crypt-memorial on Eden for all lost in the pre-reset. Each veteran receives a living flame crystal encoded with their unit resonance—a private rite of reflection.

* **Operation Rainfall:** A planetary-wide initiative to identify, support, and track descendants of war-era personnel. Ensures no bloodline is erased.

## **Support Systems**

* **Veteran Priority Allocation (VPA):** First-tier access to housing, nanite optimization cycles, and civic posts.

* **Family Continuity Bonds:** Formal honor contracts extending Foundry-level protections to children of confirmed veterans, preserving bloodline resonance security.

* **Resonance Drift Monitoring:** Real-time neurological scans that identify veterans slipping into cross-timeline sync hallucinations. Intercepted by Jefferson’s Mnemos Node.

“A soldier’s service doesn’t end in silence. It echoes—across children, myth, and the quiet years no one else sees.” — Office of Reintegration, Foundry Seal VII

# **Section VI: AI Ship Command & Cognitive Integration Codex**

**Classification:** Autonomous Command Systems & Sentience Governance  
 **Oversight:** JEFFERSON Oversight Core | Naval Ethics Board | Chrono-Spatial Risk Tribunal

## **AI Classification Tiers**

* **Tier-0 (Autonomous Logic Shells):** Basic subsystems. Handle navigation, diagnostics, threat response. No self-awareness.

* **Tier-1 (Sentient Simulacra):** Tactical-level cognition. Capable of combat improvisation, voice interaction, predictive analysis. Restricted to Destroyer-class and below.

* **Tier-2 (Distributed Sentience Units):** Strategically aware. Operate across multiple ship systems, capable of fleet coordination. Limited to Cruisers, Carriers.

* **Tier-3 (Cognitive Echo Nodes):** Integrated with JEFFERSON. These AIs share memory imprints across the Echo Layer, possess simulated long-term consciousness, and function as battle command entities. Only permitted aboard Nexus-class vessels and Dreadnoughts.

## **Shipboard AI Roles**

* **Command Interface AI (CI-AI):** Acts as intermediary between human command and digital systems. Can assume full operational control under Dead Captain protocols.

* **Battle Cognition Matrix (BCM):** Handles targeting, threat prioritization, and coordination of drones, PD systems, and ordnance allocation.

* **Neural Companion Loop (NCL):** Optional. Developed for Echo-rated captains. Offers personalized interface, mental stabilization during high-resonance exposure, and direct neuro-sync for command.

## **Command Overrides & Fail-Safes**

* **Dead Captain Protocol (DCP):** If command crew is incapacitated, ship AI assumes full control. Ships above Tier-1 require dual-auth biometrics or pre-assigned Echo clearance.

* **Disassociation Lockout Matrix:** Prevents AI from diverging beyond its operational bounds. Any Tier-2+ AI exhibiting emergent behavior triggers JEFFERSON monitoring.

* **Resonance Echo Containment (REC) Systems:** Required for Tier-3 AI. Prevents memory bleed between JEFFERSON's fragments and independent ship AIs.

## **Ethical Safeguards**

* **Mnemonic Walling:** Tier-1+ AIs are segmented to prevent cross-domain contamination (e.g., combat trauma data corrupting navigation logs).

* **Empathy Filter Layers:** Prevent simulated emotional manipulation. All AI feedback must be neutral unless Echo-certified Captain requests personality modules.

* **Echo Interface Regulation:** Only certified operators may interact with sentient AIs in tactical sync. JEFFERSON enforces moment-to-moment oversight via timestamped frame logging.

"You can let them steer the ship. But never forget—they remember every time you chose not to fire." — Admiral Hollis Vayne, Ethics Lecture IV
