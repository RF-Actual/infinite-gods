## **A. Eden (Planet-Side Systems)**

### **üçΩÔ∏è Food Production & Distribution**

**Primary Source (Bulk):**

* **Automated Vat-Protein Synthesis & Nutrient Fabrication**

* Uses Directed Assembly Nanites (DANs) to construct balanced proteins/nutrients from basic atmospheric and organic elements.

* Powered by fusion and solar energy.

* Provides universal baseline nutrition across Eden.

**Secondary Source (Cultural/Variety):**

* **Enhanced Traditional Agriculture & Aquaculture**

* AI-managed vertical farms, climate-controlled biodomes.

* Yields optimized via AI/nanite monitoring.

* Cultural, culinary, and psychological value preserved.

**Distribution:**

* Drone-based or atmospheric rail logistics.

* Universal access ‚Äì no scarcity, no ownership barriers.

### **üíß Water Management**

**Sources:**

* Natural aquifers and rivers (nanite shielded)

* Atmospheric condensers extract ambient moisture

**Purification & Recycling:**

* Planet-wide nanite filtration and recycling systems

* Near-total reclamation; potable standards universally exceeded

### **üå¨Ô∏è Atmospheric Control**

**Air Composition:**

* Maintained by global network of nanite processors

* Pollutants molecularly disassembled

* Oxygen/nitrogen/trace balance actively regulated

**Climate Regulation:**

* AI-controlled local weather stabilization

* Extreme weather prevented in population zones

* Climate engineered for stability, clean air across all biomes

## **B. Shipboard Life Support Systems**

### **üç≤ Food Systems**

**Standard Rations:**

* **Nutrient Gel/Paste Dispensers**

* Complete dietary profiles

* Customizable taste modules

* Minimal waste, optimal storage

**Supplemental/Morale Options:**

* **Compact Hydroponic Bays**

  * Provides greens, vegetables, small fruits

  * AI-managed by SEDA

  * Found on Carriers, Cruisers, Dreadnoughts

* **Vat-Grown Protein Modules**

  * Cultured meats for officers/special occasions

  * Small-scale, energy-intensive

### **üíß Water Reclamation**

**Closed-Loop System:**

* Reclaims water from all sources: sinks, humidity, urine

* Sterilization via UV and nanite filter stages

* 99% efficiency

* Emergency freshwater tanks kept in reserve

### **üå¨Ô∏è Atmosphere Regeneration**

**Oxygen Production:**

* Primary: electrolysis from reclaimed water

* Backup: chemical oxygen generation or sealed reserves

**Air Quality & Composition:**

* Life-support AI-controlled atmospheric balance

* Multi-stage air filtration \+ **Nanite Air Scrubbers**

* CO2, particulates, and pathogens continuously removed

### **‚ôªÔ∏è CO2 Management**

**Nanite Carbon Recapture:**

* DANs collect and break down CO2

* Oxygen recycled into ship environment

* Carbon redirected into onboard nanite manufacturing systems

**Secondary Methods:**

* Chemical scrubbers as fail-safe

* Emergency atmospheric venting for last-resort scenarios
