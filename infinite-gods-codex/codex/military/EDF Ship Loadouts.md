Okay, let's break down the estimated air wing composition for the EDF carriers based on their roles and the previously estimated total craft numbers. These are estimations designed to be plausible within the established lore:

**Strike Carrier (General Class \- Est. 60-100+ Total Craft)**

Assuming a typical air wing size of around **80 craft** for a carrier of this size and role:

* **Total Squadrons (Estimate):** 6 Squadrons

* **Squadron Composition (Estimate):**

  * **Fighter Squadrons (ASF-11 Echo):** 3 Squadrons  
    * *Size:* \~14 fighters per squadron  
    * *Total Fighters:* 42  
    * *Role:* Space/Air Superiority, Combat Air Patrol (CAP), Escort, Strike Escort.  
  * **Attack Squadrons (AC-70 Harbinger):** 2 Squadrons  
    * *Size:* \~12 gunships per squadron  
    * *Total Gunships:* 24  
    * *Role:* Ground Attack, Anti-shipping, Heavy Fire Support, Direct Strike.  
  * **Support/Electronic Warfare Squadron:** 1 Squadron  
    * *Size:* \~14 mixed craft/drones  
    * *Total Support Craft:* 14  
    * *Role:* Electronic Warfare (EW), Reconnaissance, Command & Control Relay, Search & Rescue, potentially light cargo/transport via specialized shuttles or larger drones.  
* **Summary:** A balanced air wing focused on deploying piloted fighters and gunships for direct power projection, supported by EW/recon assets.

**Nexus-Class Carrier (Specialized C\&C/Drone Hub \- Est. Hundreds of Drones \+ Limited Piloted Craft)**

This carrier prioritizes AI coordination and drone operations over traditional piloted craft:

* **Piloted Squadrons (Estimate):** 2 Squadrons (Limited Role)

  * **Fighter Squadron (ASF-11 Echo):** 1 Squadron  
    * *Size:* \~12 fighters per squadron  
    * *Total Fighters:* 12  
    * *Role:* Limited CAP, High-Value Escort, specialized intercept missions requiring pilot initiative.  
  * **Support/Shuttle Squadron:** 1 Squadron  
    * *Size:* \~8 specialized craft  
    * *Total Support Craft:* 8  
    * *Role:* Command Transport, Special Operations Insertion/Extraction (via stealth shuttles perhaps), high-priority logistics, Search & Rescue.  
* **Drone Compliment (Estimate):** 6-8 Drone Control Nodes/Groups

  * *Size per Node:* Managing \~25-30 drones each  
  * *Total Drones:* Est. \~150 \- 240+ drones  
  * *Role:* Multi-role drone swarms coordinated by the ship's AI and command staff. Capable of Reconnaissance, Attack (potentially kamikaze or armed drones), Electronic Warfare, Fleet Point-Defense Augmentation, potentially distributed sensor netting. They act as extensions of the carrier's will and sensor grid.  
* **Summary:** An air/space element heavily skewed towards massive, coordinated drone operations managed by sophisticated AI and a large command staff. Piloted craft serve niche or support roles rather than forming the primary offensive arm.

Based on the available information in the *Master Codex* and plausible estimations:

**1\. Fighters on Non-Carrier Ships:**

* The *Master Codex* explicitly associates fighter craft (ASF-11 "Echo") deployment with **Carriers** (Strike and Nexus classes).  
* There is **no mention** in the provided texts of Frigates, Destroyers, Cruisers, or Dreadnoughts carrying dedicated fighter complements (like the ASF-11).  
* **Conclusion:** While it's *theoretically possible* larger vessels like Cruisers or Dreadnoughts might carry a couple of small recon drones or perhaps a single utility atmospheric shuttle that *could* be armed, based strictly on the current lore, only dedicated Carriers deploy EDF fighter squadrons. Fighters likely operate primarily from Carriers or planetary bases.

**2\. Estimated Dropship/Shuttle Complements per Ship Type:**

Shuttles are essential for transport (personnel/cargo), medical evacuation, potential boarding actions, and shore leave. The Codex confirms the existence of utility shuttles (like the "Rook/Harbinger" types mentioned for specific uses) and specialized stealth drop shuttles for SOCOM. The estimated number would scale with ship size, crew complement, and mission profile:

* **FFL-9 "Lancer" (Fast Attack Frigate):** Very limited hangar space.  
  * **Estimate:** 1 Utility Shuttle.  
* **DDG-15 "Synapse" (Destroyer):** Standard complement for personnel/light cargo.  
  * **Estimate:** 1-2 Utility Shuttles.  
* **CA-21 "Aegis" (Heavy Frigate / Light Cruiser):** Enhanced independent capability requires more support.  
  * **Estimate:** 2-3 Shuttles (Mix of Utility and potentially a small Landing Craft).  
* **Cruiser (General Class):** Larger crew, command functions, often carries larger marine detachments.  
  * **Estimate:** 4-6 Shuttles (Mix of Utility, Landing Craft, possibly a Command Shuttle).  
* **Strike Carrier (General Class):** Large hangars primarily for strike craft, but still needs significant utility transport.  
  * **Estimate:** 6-8 Utility/Support Shuttles (alongside its large air wing).  
* **Nexus-Class Carrier (Specific Carrier Type):** Focus on drones/C\&C, but still requires robust personnel/cargo movement.  
  * **Estimate:** 6-8 Utility/Support Shuttles (alongside its drone complement).  
* **Dreadnought (General Class):** Massive crew and marine complement requires extensive transport capabilities.  
  * **Estimate:** 8-12+ Shuttles (Mix of Heavy Landing Craft, Utility Shuttles, Command Shuttles).  
* **Blacksite Extraction Ship (Specialized):** Mission is transport via stealth.  
  * **Estimate:** 1-2 Specialized Stealth Drop Shuttles (This is its primary payload/function, not just auxiliary craft).

Based on the established lore and the likely operational needs of the EDF Navy, here are some additional *combatant* ship classes or variants that could logically exist beyond the core Frigate-to-Dreadnought lineup and specialized support ships:

1. **Corvette / Patrol Ship (PC/PG):**

   * **Rationale:** There's a potential gap below the FFL-9 Lancer frigate. Corvettes would be smaller, faster (in-system), cheaper, and more numerous than frigates.  
   * **Role:** In-system patrol, customs enforcement, anti-piracy/smuggling operations, convoy escort within secured space, initial response force for minor incidents, supplementing planetary defense platforms. Less endurance and firepower than a frigate but sufficient for policing and low-intensity threats.  
   * **Combat Focus:** Light anti-ship capability, strong point-defense for self-protection, potentially some anti-fighter capability.  
2. **Planetary Assault Ship (LHA/LHD Analogue):**

   * **Rationale:** While troop transports move soldiers, dedicated assault ships are needed to land them under potentially hostile conditions and provide direct support. This becomes crucial if the EDF needs to project force onto contested worlds or conduct large-scale planetary interventions.  
   * **Role:** Transporting, landing, and supporting a significant ground force (marines, vehicles). Equipped with extensive shuttle/lander bays, close air support coordination facilities (for Harbingers/fighters deployed from escorting carriers or potentially a small organic detachment), command facilities for ground ops, and heavier defensive armament than a simple transport.  
   * **Combat Focus:** Primarily defensive armament, extensive point defense, coordination of ground and air assets during landings.  
3. **Specialized Anomaly Combat/Containment Vessel:**

   * **Rationale:** The unique temporal and resonance threats (Breaches, Echo Drift, Resonance Blooms, potentially hostile entities within these phenomena) might require warships specifically designed to operate and fight effectively *within* these hazardous environments. SOCOM's FORTs handle containment, but dedicated naval assets might be needed for larger or more dangerous events.  
   * **Role:** Entering unstable zones, deploying specialized dampening or stabilization fields, engaging entities resistant to conventional weapons, containing spatial anomalies. Could involve glyph-derived technology or advanced resonance manipulation tools integrated into weapon/defense systems. Might be operated by or work closely with the RAU.  
   * **Combat Focus:** Specialized shielding against temporal/resonance effects, unique weapon systems tailored to anomaly threats, advanced sensors for navigating distorted space-time. Could be variants of existing hulls (e.g., "Synapse-Temporal" Destroyer) or unique designs.  
4. **Stealth Combatant (Frigate/Destroyer Variant):**

   * **Rationale:** Beyond the purely transport/extraction role of the Blacksite ship, the EDF (especially SOCOM or STAG) might require vessels capable of covert offensive action or reconnaissance-in-force.  
   * **Role:** Covert insertion/support for special forces, stealth reconnaissance, surprise attacks on high-value targets, hunting specific enemy assets without revealing fleet movements. Sacrifices some armor/conventional firepower for advanced stealth systems, signature reduction, and potentially specialized weapons (e.g., enhanced Resonance Torpedo delivery).  
   * **Combat Focus:** Hit-and-run tactics, special operations support, intelligence gathering. Relies on not being detected as its primary defense.  
5. **Dedicated Electronic Warfare Combatant (Frigate/Destroyer Variant):**

   * **Rationale:** As suggested previously under general support ships, but emphasizing its *combat* role. While standard warships have EW suites, a dedicated platform maximizes offensive electronic attack capabilities.  
   * **Role:** Disrupting enemy C\&C, blinding sensors, disabling weapon locks, network intrusion, signals intelligence gathering *during* active fleet engagements. Designed to cripple enemy effectiveness without necessarily destroying ships directly.  
   * **Combat Focus:** Powerful jamming arrays, cyber warfare tools, advanced SIGINT collectors, robust defensive EW suites. Likely lightly armed conventionally for self-defense.

These classes address specific combat niches dictated by the unique threats (anomalies), operational requirements (planetary assault, stealth ops), and standard naval needs (system patrol, EW) suggested by the EDF's lore.
