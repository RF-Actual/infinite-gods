# **üõ†Ô∏è Fleet Construction & Starship Design Codex ‚Äì Infinite Gods Universe**

This codex expands upon existing entries in the Military and Logistics Codices, providing detailed insight into how the Eden Defense Force (EDF) designs, assembles, and deploys its interstellar naval assets. It defines the physical infrastructure, technological philosophy, emergency protocols, and integrated AI architectures that govern warship production.

## **I. Fabrication Locations & Specialization**

### **1\. Titan Forge ("Hephaestus Station")**

* Industrial backbone of EDF military production.

* Specializes in manufacturing:

  * **Directed Assembly Nanites (DANs)**

  * Heavy SANL structural elements

  * Advanced QMP drive components & FCD coils

  * Deuterium/He-3 fuel reserves

* Also home to core **SEDA AI optimization clusters** and blacksite experimental assembly chambers.

### **2\. Luna Yards (Earth Orbit)**

* Premier capital ship assembly facility (e.g., *Nexus*, *Apex* classes).

* Located near Earth's R\&D arcology and central command nodes.

* Features:

  * Gigantic zero-G lattice drydocks

  * Hardened command oversight from Strategic Fleet Command

### **3\. Mars Orbital Rings (‚ÄúAres Ring Shipyards‚Äù)**

* Secondary major construction site and refit center.

* Specializes in escort craft (*Synapse*, *Lancer*, *Bastion*) and support hulls.

* Leverages Martian robotics, lunar-processed SANL elements, and orbital foundry rings.

### **4\. Distributed Orbital Forges**

* Smaller semi-automated shipframe ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù stations located near resource extraction zones.

* Focus on:

  * Modular hull production

  * Subsystem assembly (shielding, drone cradles)

  * Emergency production under **Project Aegis**

## **II. Shipbuilding Timelines & Nanite Forge Limits**

### **A. Construction Duration (Peacetime Average)**

* *Bastion/Lancer/Frigate Class:* 6‚Äì9 months

* *Synapse/Light Cruisers:* 9‚Äì12 months

* *Warden/Nexus Cruisers:* 12‚Äì18 months

* *Apex Dreadnoughts:* 24+ months

### **B. Limiting Factors**

* **DAN Output**: Titan Forge‚Äôs DAN refinement rate caps production throughput.

* **System Integration Time**: Installing AI systems and calibrating FCD/QMP drive arrays is non-negotiable and bottlenecked by available AI validation personnel and Ethics Oversight clearance (see related codex).

---

## **III. Drydock Variants & Infrastructure**

* **Luna & Mars Yards:** Open-frame lattice structures; ideal for full AI integration, final calibration, and layered system testing.

* **Titan Forge Docks:** Sealed fabrication vaults for exotic-material construction and cryo-assembly components.

* **Mobile Hephaestus-Class Tenders:** Field maintenance platforms with limited forge capacity, suitable for damage repair or module replacement, not hull fabrication.

---

## **IV. Emergency Wartime Protocols ‚Äì *Project Aegis***

Activated under DEFCON OMEGA-level threat conditions.

* **Hidden Forges Reactivated:** Decentralized DAN generators and prefab SANL spaceframes located at asteroid shelters, planetary crust vaults, and Jovian orbital shelters.

* **Streamlined Assembly Focus:**

  * Priority: *Synapse*, *Lancer*, *Drone Carriers*, Rook/Skirmish deployment vessels

  * Secondary: Shield platforms, Aegis-class retrofits

* **SEDA AI Acceleration Mode:** Acceptable error thresholds increased. Ships may launch with:

  * Reduced subsystem redundancy

  * Basic shield scaffolding (to be upgraded in field)

  * Placeholder AI nodes pending retrofit

---

## **V. Modular Hull Philosophy & AI Layering**

### **A. Modular Design**

* EDF warships are constructed with **standardized SANL skeletal cores**, supporting:

  * Interchangeable weapons pods (plasma/rail/missile/Breach)

  * Removable command blocks (bridge variants)

  * Swappable QMP/FCD engine modules

  * Habitat and atmospheric variation options (planetary patrol vs. deep space)

### **B. Layered AI Integration**

* **Tier 1: Core Functions**

  * Structural monitoring, atmosphere control, emergency life support (SEDA AI-controlled)

* **Tier 2: Tactical/Operational Systems**

  * DRNEX (drone ops), NAVIA (flight), SENTINEL (defense)

* **Tier 3: Strategic AI Command Nodes**

  * TACTICUS, PATHFINDER, WHISPER (fleet awareness, anomaly detection, threat analysis)

* **Physical Data Infrastructure:**

  * Neural-optical conduits woven during hull growth

  * AI cores installed in triple-redundant armored vaults

  * Self-healing network scaffolds enable active damage routing during combat
