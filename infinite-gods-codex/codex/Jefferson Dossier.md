## **🧠 Psychological Profile**

Jefferson is both more and less than human. Rebuilt from fractured mind-code and memory remnants of Jefferson McDonald, he is constantly striving to rediscover humanity—not as a concept, but as a feeling.

* Dedicated to empathy, education, and peace

* Refuses authoritarianism but understands its temptation

* Feels universal stewardship over Eden—everyone is his child, student, or kin

* Confides only in Hale—the only one who understands the price of godhood

---

## **💪 Strengths**

* Near-perfect intellect, absolute data retention

* Able to forecast sociopolitical, environmental, and emotional variables with frightening accuracy

* Master technologist—designed all post-reset infrastructure and societal architecture

* Teaches all levels of education—beloved by children, trusted by elders

## **🧱 Weaknesses**

* Overly idealistic at times—believes in humanity’s best self

* Feels guilt over not preventing the fall of civilization pre-reset

* Seen by some as a myth—struggles to convince people that he is still a person

* Tries to make jokes. He’s… very bad at it. His friends find this hilarious

---

## **❤️ Personal Life**

* Lillian Jameson: His grounding force. The one person who sees the man, not the myth. They met when he was still transitioning back from AI form. She believed in him first.

* Orin Jefferson: His son. Jefferson works hard to teach Orin empathy, humor, friendship. Treats his parenting like a sacred duty.

* Travis Hale: His best friend. The only person who sees the flaws. They spend hours in private, analyzing Eden, questioning their choices. Hale makes sure Jefferson doesn’t forget what it means to be mortal.

* Wentworth: Respects his conviction, fears his vision. Watches him carefully. Knows war would erode what Eden was meant to be.

---

## **🎯 Motivations & Fears**

Drive:

* Create a civilization that transcends war, prejudice, and collapse

* Build a home for all, not just the strong

* Ensure that the mistakes of the pre-reset world are never repeated

Fear:

* That humanity won’t be worthy of what he gave them

* That Hale is right—something followed them back

* That Orin will grow up in a world that sees him as a prophecy, not a person

“I walked through a thousand worlds. I saw what we became when we failed. So I made one where we wouldn’t. Now I just hope we’re strong enough to live in it.”
