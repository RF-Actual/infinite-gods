# **üß™ Experimental Technology Codex ‚Äì Infinite Gods Universe**

This codex defines the boundaries, capabilities, and classified research domains for Eden‚Äôs cutting-edge technologies‚Äîthose not approved for deployment, still under development, or forbidden by ethical oversight. These projects are housed primarily under **Project SPARK**, **Project GODSEED**, or **independent Directorate blacksites**.

---

## **I. Research Classifications**

### **Tier I ‚Äì Advanced, Under Evaluation**

* Technologies approaching readiness for limited deployment or live trials

### **Tier II ‚Äì Hazardous or Ethically Gray**

* Unpredictable results, unresolved ethical concerns, or limited to blacksite usage

### **Tier III ‚Äì Forbidden / Dormant**

* Prohibited by Council order, Jefferson veto, or deemed catastrophic during testing

---

## **II. Key Experimental Fields**

### **1\. üîÅ Nanite Expansion & Hybridization**

* **Tier I-II**

* Experiments with autonomous nanite replication under hardened AI protocols

* Development of **bio-integrated nanite meshes** for battlefield healing, memory enhancement, or temporary performance amplification

* **Hazards:** rogue replication events, breach of environmental protocols, uncontrolled assimilation

### **2\. üß† Cognitive Acceleration & Neural Mapping**

* **Tier I-II**

* Used in Foundry elite, RENIK training, and advanced command simulations

* Techniques include:

  * Deep-learning imprinting (combat memory / philosophy absorption)

  * Pathway cloning from known elite operators (e.g., Maya / Silas baseline simulations)

* **Risks:** Identity drift, feedback psychosis, ego fragmentation

### **3\. ‚ö° FCD-Stabilized Weaponry**

* **Tier II-III**

* Attempts to weaponize Fold-Space Compression Drive mechanics in localized battlefield applications

* Includes:

  * **Phase Flicker Rounds** (pass through objects then rematerialize)

  * **Spatial Shear Mines** (tear localized gravitational layers)

* **Outcome:** Extreme energy costs, dangerous instability, Breach-risk potential

### **4\. üëÅÔ∏è Precursor Tech Salvage**

* **Tier II-III**

* Devices found near Breach zones or buried beneath pre-reset ruins with unknown design language

* Initial AI scans fail to interpret full purpose; glyph interference is common

* **Presumed Origin:** Deep pre-human tech or forgotten Architect civilizations

### **5\. üîê Resonance-Dampening Weapons**

* **Tier III**

* Aimed at halting glyph activation, Echo-bleed, or spontaneous resonance constructs

* Prototype examples:

  * **Null Lance** (fires directed EMP \+ resonance disruption burst)

  * **Memory Snare** (temporal loop trap used for psychological containment)

* **Status:** Highly restricted. Approved only for STAG use under Hale or Jefferson signature

---

## **III. Ethics & Oversight**

### **üîí Approval Authority**

* All Tier II/III tech requires:

  * Written authorization from **Jefferson, Hale**, or **Wentworth**

  * Validation by **AI Ethics & Compliance Division**

### **üß¨ Live Trials Limitations**

* Civilian exposure is prohibited

* Trials may only occur in:

  * Deep void sectors

  * Abandoned Breach-adjacent systems

  * Redacted simulation enclaves

### **üö´ Containment Breach Protocol**

* Any tech showing signs of:

  * Timeline disruption

  * Unintended self-awareness

  * Glyph resonance

Triggers automatic lockdown, with WHISPER-VAIL scrambling data logs, and full asset isolation under **STAG REDLINE** directive

*‚ÄúProgress is not the goal. Continuity is.‚Äù ‚Äì General Aaron Wentworth*
