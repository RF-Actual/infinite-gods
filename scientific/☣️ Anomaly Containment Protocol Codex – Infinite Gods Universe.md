# **‚ò£Ô∏è Anomaly Containment Protocol Codex ‚Äì Infinite Gods Universe**

This codex details the standardized containment, quarantine, and neutralization procedures employed by the Eden Defense Force (EDF), Intelligence Directorate, and STAG/RAU operations teams in the event of temporal instability, Echo-bloodline drift, Breach energy contamination, or resonance anomalies.

## **I. Classification of Anomalies**

### **‚åõ A-Class ‚Äì Temporal Drift Events**

* Time distortion localized to a person, object, or limited geographic zone

* May include: repeating time loops, time dilation fields, historical overlays

* Triggers:

  * Echo-child dreamwalk bleedthrough

  * Unsealed pre-Reset relics carrying resonance charge

### **üåÄ B-Class ‚Äì Spatial Inversion / Breach Echo**

* Spacetime folds, reality layering, environmental anomalies (non-Euclidean space, geometry warping)

* Often associated with proximity to **Forbidden Timeline fractures**

### **üîÆ C-Class ‚Äì Psychological Contamination**

* Cognitive contamination via Echo contact, glyph resonance, or subconscious alignment with alternate realities

* Symptoms: d√©j√† vu loops, Echo-triggered visioning, compulsive glyph sketching, sudden language shift, quantum stuttering (intermittent location change without movement)

### **‚ò¢Ô∏è D-Class ‚Äì Resonant Instability / Uncontrolled Glyph Manifestation**

* Limited to Echo-bloodline individuals

* Includes spontaneous glyph expression, materialization of impossible structures, or environmental reshaping

* Considered a catastrophic failure of internal containment equilibrium

## **II. Response Protocols**

### **üß™ Phase I ‚Äì Identification & Initial Quarantine**

* Deployed Units: Local EDF patrols or RAU sensors identify high-probability anomaly signatures

* Actions:

  * Civilians are redirected via cover story (atmospheric leak, energy fluctuation)

  * AI sweep initiated using **WHISPER \+ BALANCE** for local cognition shifts

  * RAU deploys mobile resonance containment field (MCF) drones

### **üîí Phase II ‚Äì Securing the Zone**

* STAG or FORT teams establish perimeter control with glyph-sealed hardlines (if Echo-triggered)

* Deployment of **PATHFINDER sub-drones** to record localized spacetime instability

* If Echo-lineage suspected, MNEMOS is activated to cross-reference known bloodline profiles

* Area declared RED-ECHO (containment critical) or BLACK-FRAY (pre-collapse containment breach imminent)

### **üß¨ Phase III ‚Äì Subject Isolation**

* Involved individuals are either:

  * *Voluntarily extracted* to containment facilities (via Rook/Harbinger shuttles)

  * *Stabilized on-site* via cognitive null-fields and nanite stasis rigs

* For confirmed C or D-Class anomalies:

  * Individuals are sedated and transported to **Echo Lock Facility Theta-Zero** (classified)

  * Under no circumstances are glyphs to be interacted with directly unless cleared by Jefferson or Hale

### **üîì Phase IV ‚Äì Anomaly Resolution or Sealing**

* Resolution:

  * Spacetime damage may be healed via high-density resonance suppression fields or PATHFINDER-directed FCD implosion calibration

  * Nanite flooding used to deconstruct materialized objects

* Sealing:

  * For unrecoverable zones, facility-level quarantine may be enacted

  * Forbidden zones are sealed and erased from public records (implemented by WHISPER-VAIL protocol)

## **III. Containment Assets**

### **Drones**

* **MCF-13**: Mobile Containment Field drone

* **Rook-class**: Tactical insertion/retrieval and anomaly suppression

* **Scryer Swarms**: Miniature reconnaissance drones mapping anomaly boundaries and data streams

### **Facilities**

* **Theta-Zero**: Blacksite-level Echo containment facility

* **RAU Deep Archives**: Hosts recovered anomaly data for encrypted analysis

### **AI Oversight**

* **PATHFINDER:** Predictive anomaly mapping

* **WHISPER:** Signal disruption analysis and memory distortion tracking

* **BALANCE:** Monitors psychological instability

---

## **IV. Public Management Protocols**

* **Cover Story Examples:**

  * ‚ÄúLocalized radiation event‚Äù

  * ‚ÄúFailed gravitic test‚Äù

  * ‚ÄúSpontaneous mineral ignition‚Äù

* Witnesses undergo:

  * Psychological screening

  * Neural sedation (if needed)

  * In extreme cases, **controlled memory containment protocols** (authorized by the Council)

*‚ÄúNot every threat wears armor. Some unfold beneath your feet.‚Äù ‚Äì STAG Operator Luc√≠a Alvarado*
