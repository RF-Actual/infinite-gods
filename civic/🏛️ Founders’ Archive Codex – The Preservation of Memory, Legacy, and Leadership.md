 **Oversight:** Department of Public Information & Access, Memory Integrity Council, Ruling Council (Founding Seat Custodians)

## **I. Purpose**

To preserve, teach, and sanctify the legacy of those who rebuilt the world from the ashes of collapse. This codex defines what is recorded, what is shared, and what is protected within Eden’s official narrative regarding the founding generation—especially the RENIK survivors, Jefferson McDonald, and Travis Hale.

“The future must remember not who ruled, but who served.” – Silas Hale, Foundry Address, Year 2032

## **II. The Battle at Omnivault – The Final Resistance**

### **A. The Public Record**

Citizens of Eden are taught that the **collapse of the old world** came not from natural causes alone, but from a perfect storm of:

* Technological overreach (Nyra, Spectra)

* Governmental paralysis

* A hidden war fought in silence

At the heart of this collapse was **Facility Omnivault**, a classified research installation where technologies capable of altering reality were hidden, suppressed, and exploited.

The public knows:

* **RENIK**, an elite special operations force of international survivors, launched a final operation to **breach Omnivault** and seize control of its core assets.

* **Travis Hale and Jefferson McDonald**, the two field commanders of that strike, were both **mortally wounded** and **transformed** by exposure to experimental technology previously hoarded by failed regimes.

* In the aftermath, that tech was **repurposed**—not for domination, but for healing. Cities reformed. Disease vanished. Water became clean. The Earth, for the first time in memory, became *livable*.

This miracle was not divine, but the result of two warriors choosing peace when they could have ruled.

“It was not fire that rebuilt the world. It was refusal.” – Official Archive Inscription, Memorial Chamber

## **III. The Sarcophagi – Tombs of the First Flame**

### **A. Memorial Construction**

* Located in **Vault Theta**, beneath the central arcology of Eden’s capital, the Memorial Chamber houses **sarcophagi representing the founders**.

* Each monument is constructed of SANL-forged obsidian-lattice and inscribed with the core virtue that founder embodied: *Sacrifice, Duty, Precision, Integrity, Foresight, Compassion, Silence, Service, Restraint, Fire.*

### **B. Who Lies There**

* **Jefferson McDonald** – symbolic vessel of his synthetic body, now reformed as biological.

* **Travis Hale** – sealed chamber representing his “death” at Omnivault and rebirth into Eden.

* **Aaron Wentworth**, **Allison Wentworth**, **Yasmine Hale**, **Lillian McDonald**, and all RENIK leaders are preserved in **cryo-temporal suspension**, their DNA sealed in ceremonial capsules, ready for reconstitution in worst-case contingencies.

* **Fallen RENIK** members are remembered in engraved kinetic plates that surround the chamber.

“Here lie those who did not ask to be gods—and refused to become tyrants.”

### **C. Public Access**

* Eden citizens may enter the **outer memorial galleries**, view the monuments, read select journal entries, and participate in **Founders’ Day rituals**.

* The **inner sanctum** is restricted to Foundry cadets, senior government officials, and selected RENIK descendants.

## **IV. Memory as Governance**

### **A. Educational Doctrine**

* All Foundry students take **“Pre-Eden History & Reformation Ethics”**, focused on:

  * The fall of Spectra

  * The ethics of concealed technology

  * The price of second chances

* Historical records emphasize the fragility of freedom and the responsibility of power.

### **B. The Department of Public Information & Access**

* Curates records for public knowledge while coordinating with SHIELD-0 and MNEMOS to redact or sanitize:

  * Glyph-related phenomena

  * Timeline destabilization events

  * Forbidden timeline incursions

* The public is told the **collapse was “spatial-temporal in origin,”** but details are symbolic and mythologized.

“The children must remember what we chose—not what we fought.” – Yasmine Hale

### **C. Lineage and Inheritance**

* The children of the founders (Maya, Orin, Silas, Stellan, Lucia, Emiliano, and others) are **taught to honor legacy but never rely upon it.**

* Each one must earn public trust and leadership through service, not lineage.

* This is reinforced in civic exams, Foundry coursework, and media.

“Your name is not your inheritance. Your burden is.” – Lillian McDonald

## **V. Classified Archives – Ruling Council Only**

The following records exist in **classified vaults** beneath the Founders’ Archive:

* The full logs of **Facility Theta** during the final moments of the collapse

* Jefferson’s raw interaction logs with the Nyx-Class Q-Core

* The **Paradox Clause**: sealed records noting the existence of **Maya and Orin’s child** and the theoretical emergence of **Alpha Prime**

* Timeline reconvergence theories and pre-reset resonance loops

Only the Ruling Council may access this data. Even most AI are **air-gapped** from it.

“We do not hide history because it is shameful. We hide it because it still breathes.” – Jefferson McDonald

---

## **VI. Cultural Legacy & Civic Integration**

* **Founders’ Day**: Celebrated every year on the calendar date of the Omnivault Assault. Includes:

  * Service ceremonies

  * Public readings of the Eden Codex

  * Volunteer hours in infrastructure renewal

* **Foundry Pilgrimage:** Every final-year cadet walks the Sarcophagi in silence before graduation. They must answer a single question aloud in the Vault: *“What virtue will you embody?”*

“We are the echo of their restraint. The resonance of their mercy.” – Eden Creed, Line 17
