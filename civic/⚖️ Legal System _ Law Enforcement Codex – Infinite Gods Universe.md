# **‚öñÔ∏è Legal System / Law Enforcement Codex ‚Äì Infinite Gods Universe**

---

## **A. Foundational Law & Principles**

* **Basis:** Operates under an **abridged and adapted version of the United States Constitution**, emphasizing individual rights (speech, belief, assembly‚Äîwithin bounds of societal stability), due process, and equal protection under the law. Modifications account for advanced technology, post-scarcity economics, and an interplanetary society.

* **Focus:** With basic needs met and many traditional causes of crime removed (poverty, disease), the legal system focuses more on interpersonal disputes, negligence/accidents, violations of privacy/data integrity, misuse of technology, civic participation compliance (e.g., mandatory voting), and maintaining public order. **Restorative justice and rehabilitation** are emphasized over punitive measures where feasible.

## **B. Jurisdiction**

### **üõ°Ô∏è Interplanetary Accords**

* A unified legal framework, ratified by the central Legislature and Ruling Council, governs interactions and legal standards across Earth (Eden) and Solar System colonies (Mars, Europa, Titan).

* Experimental interstellar outposts operate under **provisional EDF/Exploration Corps regulations**:

  * These include **command-based emergency tribunal authority**. Outpost commanders may hold field courts-martial or summary arbitration in the absence of real-time QEB comms, with **Pathfinder AI** verification for post-action oversight.

### **üöî Civilian Law Enforcement (CLE)**

* **Mandate:** Day-to-day policing within civilian populations on Eden and colonies. Responsibilities include dispute resolution, minor infractions, privacy violations, technology misuse, and maintaining civic norms.

* **Structure:** Local/regional departments tied to municipal councils, overseen by the **Ministry of Justice**. Officers prioritize de-escalation and utilize non-lethal weapons (e.g., SDW-4 sonic/concussive systems).

* **Limitations:** CLE officers do not hold jurisdiction over EDF military zones or personnel on active duty.

### **ü™ñ Eden Defense Force (EDF) Jurisdiction**

* **Mandate:** Enforces the **Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)** across all EDF branches (Navy, Marines, Intelligence, SOCOM).

* **Scope:** Full authority over military zones, naval vessels, restricted colonies, and active operations (e.g., Breach containment). May only intervene in civilian areas under specific emergency authorization protocols.

## **C. Courts & Trials**

### **‚öñÔ∏è Civilian Court System**

* **Structure:** Local ‚Üí Appellate ‚Üí Supreme Court (17 Justices, confirmed by Ruling Council)

* **Process:** AI assists with evidence collation and legal research; human judges preside. Most trials emphasize **resolution, restitution, and rehabilitation**. Serious crimes may result in **neurological realignment**, restricted simulation sentencing, or **exile to secure environments**‚Äîtraditional incarceration is rare.

### **ü™ñ Military Court System**

* **Structure:** Standard courts-martial under the UCMJ

* **Scope:** Applies to all active and reserve EDF personnel

### **üîí Blacksite & Classified Tribunal Protocols**

* **No formal civilian court oversight.**

* Cases involving Blacksite assets (GODSEED, SPARK, VANTAGE), SOCOM, STAG, or Echo anomalies are reviewed by:

  * Internal **Intelligence Directorate review boards**

  * **Sealed EDF tribunals** convened under Defense Secretary Wentworth

  * **Direct Ruling Council involvement** (if existential threat or bloodline Echo is involved)

* **Outcomes may include:** reassignment, memory containment (see Psych Codex), indefinite secured confinement, or termination. Requires unanimous authorization from Jefferson, Hale, and Defense Command.

---

## **D. AI Oversight & Enforcement**

### **ü§ñ Ethics & Compliance Division**

* Specialized wing of the Intelligence Directorate, monitoring civilian and military AI compliance in conjunction with the Ministry of Justice.

* **Key assets:**

  * **BALANCE AI:** Monitors neural and social drift across society

  * **SENTINEL:** Safeguards EDF networks and AI integrity

  * Automated audits for unauthorized AI creation or sentience simulation

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Violations**

* Minor: access loss, reeducation

* Severe: weaponized AI, attempt to clone pre-Reset constructs (e.g., Nyra) ‚Üí **immediate STAG dispatch** and possible tribunal escalation

---

## **E. Civilian Restrictions on Banned Iconography (Glyph Protections)**

### **üö´ Legal Framing**

* Civilian interaction with Echo-related phenomena is handled under **Trauma Symbol Sensitivity Regulation 44-C**, which prohibits creation or dissemination of visual patterns known to induce psychological distress in pre-Reset trauma survivors or glyph-sensitive individuals.

### **üîç Enforcement**

* Violations are handled with:

  * Education and reconditioning for first offenses

  * Artistic restriction licenses (revocation of public display or publication rights)

  * Monitoring of creative outputs flagged by **MNEMOS AI**

* Intentional replication of glyph-like imagery may trigger a **RAU/PATHFINDER scan** and referral to Intelligence Directorate for deeper review

*‚ÄúLaw does not merely protect the living‚Äîit protects the reality in which they live.‚Äù ‚Äì Chief Executive Justice Dalia Merin*
