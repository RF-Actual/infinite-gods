## **Core Medical Infrastructure**

### **Med-Nanite Regulation Cycle**

* Routine bio-nanite diagnostic checks every 15‚Äì30 days.

* Early detection of health anomalies and initiation of non-invasive corrections.

  ### **Trauma Drone Triage (TDT)**

* Autonomous drones providing immediate stabilization at injury sites.

* Real-time trauma assessment and prioritized evacuation to the nearest MedCore facility.

  ### **MedCore Facilities**

* Advanced medical centers managed by AI, utilizing resonance-enhanced medical suites.

* Facilities tailored for surgical intervention, physical restoration, and comprehensive psychological rehabilitation.

  ### **Specialized CBRN Response Units**

* Units deployed specifically for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and temporal anomalies.

* Equipped with specialized nanite swarms and protective resonance fields.

  ## **Protocols & Ethical Oversight**

  ### **Trauma Threshold Index (TTI)**

* A predictive metric evaluating the risk of psychological trauma associated with extensive regenerative procedures.

* Determines suitability and timing of regenerative interventions.

  ### **Consent Matrix Override**

* Applied strictly in emergency scenarios involving battlefield injuries or unconscious patients.

* Reviewed post-event by a tiered AI-human ethics committee to maintain transparency and accountability.

  ### **Memory Reconciliation Suite (MRS)**

* Ensures psychological continuity and identity coherence following substantial physical regeneration.

* Employs mnemonic scaffolding, targeted dream integration, and resonance therapies.
