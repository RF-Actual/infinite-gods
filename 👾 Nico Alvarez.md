# **👾 Nico Alvarez**

*“He’s not trying to change the world—he’s trying to map it in real-time, frame by frame.”*

---

## **🧍 Appearance**

* **Age:** 7

* **Height:** 4'4"

* **Hair:** Black, curly, cropped short but always messy

* **Eyes:** Bright brown, full of curiosity and calculation

* **Skin:** Olive-toned, inherited from his mother

* **Style:** Always has a drone tether on his belt, goggles around his neck, and at least one shirt pocket stuffed with a microchip he swears is important

---

## **🤖 Personality**

* Cheerful, eager, *tirelessly inquisitive*

* Asks more questions than the system can log

* Loves being part of the crew—but if excluded, he’ll quietly follow with a hovering eye-bot

* Doesn’t understand why other kids act like they’re carrying some huge destiny

* To Nico, the world *is* Eden. Always has been. Why would it be anything else?

---

## **🧠 Strengths**

* Natural-born drone operator—his reflexes and data parsing are ahead of cadet-level operators

* Already talking casually with AI instructors in multi-thread conversations

* Excellent situational awareness, especially in open terrain

* Builds virtual terrain simulations for fun, then sends them to Jefferson “for review” (Jefferson always sends back smiley faces and diagnostics)

---

## **⚠️ Weaknesses**

* Over-relies on tech when interpersonal instincts would serve better

* Gets defensive when left out—his fallback is to watch instead of ask

* Sometimes loses focus during team drills if his AI isn’t part of it

---

## **🎮 Hobbies & Habits**

* Talks to AI instructors like they’re friends

* Has names for all his drones (“Blinky,” “Clicker,” “Mom2,” “Goliath Jr.”)

* Leaves tech modules in odd places, forgets where he left them

* Draws schematics in the dirt with sticks during field exercises

---

## **👪 Family**

* **Father:** Rafael “Rook” Alvarez – drone operator and RENIK recon expert

  * Nico idolizes him, but is determined to surpass him

* **Mother:** Marina Alvarez – aerospace systems designer

  * She helps him build drones that “look cool even when they crash”

---

## **🌌 Perspective**

* Doesn’t feel pressure from legacy or prophecy

* He believes in cause and effect, not fate

* When Maya flares, when Orin goes quiet—Nico just *watches*, and logs the data

* Might grow into one of the most emotionally balanced of the entire Eden youth group

“When people talk about timelines and collapse, I don’t really get it. But I do know that Maya’s emotional surge patterns spike 12.8% when she’s arguing with Cassia. That seems more useful.”
