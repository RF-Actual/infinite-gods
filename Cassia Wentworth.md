## **👥 Family Dynamics**

* **Kieran:**

  * Loves him. Resents him. *Watches him.*

  * Thinks he’s too perfect—too fast, too clever.

  * Sometimes wonders if Mom and Dad expect her to follow his lead forever

  * Has noticed that he *never* trips. Or sneezes. Or struggles with math. It’s… weird.

* **Jude:**

  * Protective of her little brother, even when he annoys her

  * Teaches him how to swear properly, then tells him not to say it near Mom

  * She calls them “the bookends” of their family—Kieran the start, Jude the surprise

* **Allison:**

  * Wants to be like her. Trains to be like her. Will never admit it

  * Keeps score of how often her mom picks Kieran for special projects

  * Still crawls into her lap on bad days, even if she pretends she’s “just cold”

* **Aaron:**

  * Scared of disappointing him

  * Tries to make him laugh. It doesn’t always work

  * Sometimes hears him talk about duty and wonders if *she’s enough*
