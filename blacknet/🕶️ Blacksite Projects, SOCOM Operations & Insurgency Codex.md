# **üï∂Ô∏è Blacksite Projects, SOCOM Operations & Insurgency Codex**

This codex outlines the structure and operations of Eden‚Äôs most classified programs, elite special forces, and protocols surrounding internal threats. It merges Codex entries \#13, Phase II \#3, and Phase II \#16.

## **A. Blacksite Projects ‚Äì *Warden Protocols (Classified)***

### **üß† Project GODSEED**

* **Focus:** Strategic Predictive Intelligence (SPI), not biological enhancement

* **Goal:** Develop advanced, non-sentient AI to forecast large-scale threats and societal trends using pre-Alpha Prime computational models

* **Method:** Combines:

  * Jefferson‚Äôs foundational logic trees

  * Background resonance fluctuations

  * Precursor tech remnants

* **Status:** Theoretical AI construct housed in shielded off-world cores

### **üëÅÔ∏è Project VANTAGE**

* **Focus:** Passive monitoring of Breach-adjacent timelines

* **Method:**

  * Deploys long-duration sensor platforms near known spacetime distortions

  * Uses exotic particle detectors, gravitational lenses, QEB relays

  * No interaction with alternate timelines

* **Status:** Active and maintained by SOCOM/FORT teams

### **‚öõÔ∏è Project SPARK**

* **Focus:** Analysis of anomalous tech or energy recovered from Breach incursions

* **Method:**

  * Experiments in secure deep-labs (Mars, Titan)

  * Studies physical anomalies, resonance disruption, and matter instability

* **Status:** Informs EDF defensive weapons development and RAU sensor tuning

## **B. Special Operations Command ‚Äì *The RENIK Legacy***

### **üéØ Operational Ties**

* **VANTAGE Support:** FORT teams maintain/protect deep-space platforms

* **SPARK Containment:** TechOps or Bricks-led crews recover tech, secure labs

* **Nyra Vault Security:** Glyph-sealed relic vaults under AI and SOCOM guard

* **Contingency:** Only Hale/Jefferson can access certain vaults; unauthorized breaches trigger immediate STAG/FORT deployment

### **üõë Disavowed Operations**

* STAG units act under full denial protocols

* May use unregistered weapons/gear

* Often embedded in civilian systems for internal risk suppression

---

## **C. Internal Threats ‚Äì *Insurgency & Dissent Patterns***

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Threat Vectors**

* **Philosophical Dissent:** Non-violent critics of centralized control; monitored

* **Echo Cults:** Fringe belief systems worshiping Jefferson/Hale or the Reset

* **Nyra Sympathizers:** Rare and high-priority threats

* **Colonial Discontent:** Emerging in outer settlements; logistical tension

### **üõ°Ô∏è EDF Response Protocol**

* **Intel Directorate:** Monitors low-grade threats

* **Civil Enforcement Units:** Handle minor infractions

* **STAG/FORT Deployment:** Activated for high-risk targets involving:

  * Technology leaks

  * Anomalous energy

  * Threats to Glyph-bearers or vaults

### **üß® Unknown Variables**

* Rumors of unsanctioned blacksites or cultic research cells

* Vaults unknown even to Jefferson or buried by Precursor entities

* RAU and PATHFINDER maintain passive scan operations for emergence events

*"Secrecy protects us from enemies. But it also hides the moments we become them." ‚Äì Rook, RENIK survivor*
